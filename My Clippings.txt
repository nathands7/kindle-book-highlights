Tudo sobe ou desce por causa da liderança Algumas pessoas pensam que não precisam aprender sobre liderança porque atualmente não estão exercendo a função de líder. Na verdade, todo ser humano precisará liderar em alguma esfera da vida. É também verdade que uma família, uma empresa, uma Igreja e até uma cidade, estado ou país, sobe ou desce por causa da liderança.

sucesso do líder não são suas conquistas, mas seus sucessores. Um líder aprovado por Deus entende que o seu chamado é maior que a sua própria vida, então ele vive para além de si mesmo. Ele possibilita que a próxima geração não precise começar do zero. Um líder chamado por Deus entende que o plantio dele é carvalho. E, plantar carvalhos significa semear e regar para que a próxima geração tenha sombra sob a qual descansar.

mas que persistem em viver como que cegos, realizando os ofícios pastorais de forma tradicional e rotineira, seja na visitação, pregação, cultos de ceia, batismo ou fúnebres. Não conseguem avançar, enquanto desenvolvem seus ministérios por anos a fio sem avaliação, atualização ou transição para novas realidades de um mundo que está em constante mudanças. Na verdade, não avaliam porque sabem que o resultado será: ou você muda ou morre! E será difícil lidar com esta realidade. Ignorar e deixar como está é uma fuga que não exige mudar de endereço.

Um líder precisa de um plano, não apenas de um alvo. Chegar rápido não tem a ver com fé, mas com ansiedade. A fé espera e antecipa o futuro, enquanto a ansiedade precipita e adia a visão. Duas atmosferas podem destruir o alcance de uma visão de Deus para um líder: a ansiedade e o medo.

Tenha cuidado com lugares nocivos, venenosos, estéreis, inúteis e infrutíferos. Cuidado com os ambientes que já fizeram com que você perdesse a visão, o que pode significar um ambiente, hábitos e até colegas de profissão. Podem ser tradições, denominações ou até amigos. Onde fica sua Betsaida? Decida romper com o que não revela a você luz e visão. Talvez você não seja compreendido por todos. Talvez seja criticado por decidir se afastar. São preços a serem pagos, mas que sempre serão menores do que perder a própria visão.

Ninguém nasce um líder. Podemos nascer com habilidades muito apropriadas à liderança, dadas por Deus a nós, porém, a liderança em si é sempre algo que é desenvolvido e constantemente lapidado. A liderança é algo que desenvolvemos por meio do conhecimento, da leitura, da formação, da submissão às autoridades e líderes, da organização pessoal, da comunicação e da disciplina. Liderança é algo que se desenvolve a partir da busca de uma visão, da vivência de uma paternidade bem resolvida, de muita dedicação, do conhecimento de novos lugares, pessoas e culturas. É um processo constante de mudanças e crescimento internos.

Uma frase atribuída a Abraham Lincoln diz que o caráter é como uma árvore e a reputação como sua sombra. A sombra é o que nós pensamos dela; a árvore é a coisa real. Todos que olharem para a árvore verão a mesma imagem. Porém, sua sombra permite diferentes perspectivas, de acordo com a posição do sol e a posição da pessoa em relação a ela. Assim é a vida com relação ao caráter e reputação. Enquanto o caráter é aquilo que você realmente é, sua reputação dependerá da interpretação de outras pessoas — e nem sempre ela reflete exatamente a realidade. Você não tem qualquer controle sobre o que pensam de você e, por isso, é uma tarefa impossível cuidar da própria reputação; tudo o que podemos fazer é cuidar de nosso próprio caráter.

2 Coríntios 2:15 Nos dias do Império Romano, usava-se o incenso em todos os tipos de rituais religiosos, inclusive em cultos ao imperador. As religiões orientais como o budismo fazem muito o uso do incenso até hoje, assim como acontecia na Antiguidade nos cultos dos gregos a seus deuses. No judaísmo, aromas de incenso eram utilizados no templo, porém, trava-se de um incenso diferente dos demais, com uma mistura própria que só poderia ser usada para aquele fim. Assim, na época de Paulo, era possível distinguir muito bem o aroma das ofertas em adoração a Deus dos perfumes dos incensos pagãos. Foi neste contexto que o apóstolo afirma que quem tem Jesus tem um perfume diferente.

Muitos líderes erraram e desgastarem sua equipe porque tentaram forçar pessoas a darem resultados em áreas em que eram fracas. Isso não é sábio nem inteligente. Por outro lado, o líder é capaz de enxergar potencial nas pessoas onde elas jamais enxergariam. Ele forma pessoas, dá responsabilidades graduais e autonomia crescente.

Em sua liderança, você precisa frequentemente receber pessoas novas. Incluir gente nova oxigena a equipe e a torna mais saudável. O pensamento do Reino de Deus é este: sempre há espaço para mais um. Isso precisa ser um valor do líder como também de sua equipe, porque quando novas pessoas chegam, também é uma oportunidade de formar novos líderes.

Neste trecho de Atos, é muito interessante notar a lista dos nomes dos novos líderes selecionados para aquela nova missão: lemos nomes gregos e judeus, gente de diferentes origens e culturas. Algo, no entanto, era comum entre eles: eram homens de bom testemunho, tinham sabedoria e eram cheios do Espírito Santo. Eles eram reconhecidamente pessoas de caráter e tinham a capacidade para lidar com o problema. Inclua pessoas novas, com caráter, capacitação e diferentes de você.

Você pode ser um líder que lida bem com crescimentos altos e mudanças velozes, desde que tenha um estilo de vida equilibrado, com emoções ajustadas, hábitos saudáveis e relacionamentos sólidos. Crie para si mesmo ciclos de trabalho, descanso, lazer, sono, sonhos, resultados e recompensas. Busque equilíbrio em meio à velocidade. Não confunda intensidade com desequilíbrio. Somente o equilíbrio tem o poder para sustentar a intensidade e a velocidade. O segredo não está em acender a chama, mas em mantê-la acesa!

Você não pode entrar em algo novo só na base da opinião ou do que acha. É preciso pesquisar sobre aquela área, entender o que há ali, qual a dinâmica, qual os pontos positivos e os negativos. Precisa conversar com quem conhece sobre o assunto melhor do que você. Uma das razões pelas quais a esmagadora maioria dos novos negócios fecham depois de poucos anos de abertura é que a pesquisa não foi feita como se deveria. Pesquise, ouça, leia e ore; estude primeiro e invista depois.

What happens when you condemn or belittle yourself? Consider that God knew you before time began and made you in his image. What happens when you attack yourself? If you tear yourself down, you are directly challenging God’s opinion of you. If God thinks you’re spectacular and you think you’re inferior, you have no congruency with God.

Jesus’s first encounter with Peter shows us how God saw him. During their very first meeting at the Jordan River, John 1:42, Jesus changed Peter’s name from Simon to Peter. The name Simon is itself a pretty good, sonorous sounding name. It means, “God hears.” However, Jesus wanted Peter to recognize that it wasn’t about what he thought of God but, rather, what God thought of him.

Jesus saw (and still sees!) people as they could be, as the people they can become. He selected all twelve of his disciples with this forward vision. Yet, we generally see people in terms of their histories. We see men as trees walking, not as rocks from which the foundations and walls of the church will be built. We tend to see people for all their problems, imperfections, weaknesses, idiosyncrasies, and failures. Jesus sees people as God originally created them to be, then calls forth the beauty of their true selves for all to see. We habitually view others in a dimly lit and limited way. When we see clearly—as God does, through his Son-glasses—we see phenomenal potential in others, and we see the compassion of God working through their lives and out into the world.

I pray that when I get to heaven, I will see a line of men as far as the eye can see who have become all that Jesus intended them to be because of my positive influence in their lives.

God has designed us in such a way that we have tremendous mental tools at our disposal. Proverbs 23:7 says, “For as he thinks in his heart, so is he” (NKJV).

Here’s a final thought on our identity in God. Not only are we empowered to change our behavior, God requires us to change our behavior to comport with our perfection in Christ. For God’s child, it’s not optional. As the most dutiful Father, he will not allow his children to behave according to their old sinful identity. But this book is full of good news, and here’s some more. As we begin to see ourselves as our Father sees us and to recognize his power at work within us, the desire to make those changes will grow in our hearts. Not only do we get his identity, he gives us an incentive to flourish in his design. That’s real freedom in Christ!

Guys, our moral character is far more than only our sexual conduct. In fact, in my opinion, the most important part of a man’s character is his ability to keep his word. When we say that we’ll be somewhere at a certain time, we need to be there and be on time. When we say we’ll return a neighbor’s hammer, we have to do it. But let’s be real here and get this out in the open. There is no sin so devastating, guilt-ridden, secretly-conducted, and deeply-addictive as sexual sin. Men, we need to look sexual sin square in the eye and confront it. I will spend most of this chapter dealing with it and sharing keys for prevailing over this noxious and devastating immoral behavior.

Men, as believers, we will be raised from the dead or translated at Christ’s return. As I write this, I marvel at God’s plan. Our bodies will be changed into an eternal form exactly like the eternal body of Jesus. In fact, Paul says that our bodies don’t even belong to us any longer. They were purchased by Jesus and belong to him. That’s why this issue of sexual sin is so important! When we profane our bodies with sexual connection outside of marriage, we ignore and negate the purpose for which our bodies were redeemed. Our bodies are not meant to be “one” with sexual partners outside of marriage. They are not meant to be profaned by illicit sexual and immoral behavior. Quintessentially, sexual sin violates God’s claim on our bodies as his holy temple.

The problem is not sexual activity. It is in man’s attempt to enjoy sex outside the boundaries of marriage. Sex in magazines, sex with ourselves, sex on the internet, sex with someone besides our wife, sex with a person of the same sex, and sex in movies are all illegitimate forms of sexual release. God wants us to have sexual activity in ways which honor him. He doesn’t want us to have sex with the wrong person or in the wrong way. God is amazingly and purposefully narrow-minded about sex. He wants us to know the fulfillment he intended for it by having sex only with a wife, and, for the unmarried man, he wants us to wait on sexual activity until that bond has been established. Since God is the creator of sex, we can be certain he’s clear on how he wants it to function.

I’ve met men who have experienced true sexual freedom in Christ. These fellows seem to have a couple of things in common. They have the activity of the Holy Spirit present in their lives and they have a willingness to be open, vulnerable, and accountable. There are several other common personality patterns in those holding true sexual freedom, but these seem to be most critical.

Even when we have been seriously wounded, we must take ownership for our own anger, verbal or physical abuse, performance-based demands, abandonment, or controlling behaviors. If our family members have suffered because of the emotional or physical abuse we’ve put them through, it’s imperative that we reverse our actions and seek emotional and relational healing and reconciliation. Mending Damage We’ve Caused Others! Be honest. Appraise the pain you have inflicted on others. Stand up and admit it, not fearing consequences and understanding how you’ll hurt these people more and more if you don’t stop. If you really aren’t sure if you’ve hurt them, ask them. I’m sure they’ll be much more honest than you’d like. Ask their forgiveness. A dad who says, “I’m wrong, please forgive me,” brings more healing than can be imagined. You can’t undo the past, but an apology can start an astonishing healing process. Forgive yourself. After you’ve repented and sought forgiveness for any injury you have caused your family members, you must forgive yourself. Browbeating yourself is not only counterproductive but also dangerous.

It started with my repentance to the Lord, and, honestly, that took a long time. God patiently brought to mind every instance of my destructive behavior in other people’s lives. The second step was to repent to people, and, over the years, I’ve addressed numerous issues either by personal contact or with letters.

Jim’s words help us understand the real heart of a Teleios Man. The ability to deal with things so deeply and emotionally painful is the root of all true spirituality.

To be a true Teleios Man, we must understand that the way up in God is to get down, that we must humble ourselves to the place of brokenness and service. That’s the same way to be great before our wives and families: humble ourselves and sacrificially serve them. We know we have succeeded as Teleios Men when our Lord, our wives, and our families all see daily signs in the choices we make that we consider them more important than ourselves. When they do, we’re experiencing his completion.

It intuitively follows that only another man could rectify the results of that sin. Thus we have the grand and ultimate solution in the death of the last Adam, Jesus Christ. Adam’s sin was rectified when Jesus died on the cross and presented to the Father his blood as the full and final payment for sin. Following that, it’s our responsibility as believing men to rectify and reverse the sin of Adam by daily reclaiming our headship. We can no longer allow the world’s greatest travesty, the abdication of headship, to wreak havoc in the lives of our wives and children—leaving them vulnerable to deception. Men

The head of the natural body is the source of both direction and authority. The individual members of the physical body would be both powerless and directionless except for the head. The thumb, elbow, feet, eyes, and ears all provide needed functions for the body, but if not for the head, the body’s individual functions would be random and confused. What brings all things together in purpose and function is the head. If the head, through injury or disease, is unable to produce the necessary direction, the body becomes dysfunctional and paralyzed.

It can mean everything from spoken words, to an embrace, to flowers, to building her up publicly, to listening to her, to taking out the garbage, to opening her car door, to writing love notes, to taking her to special places. But first and foremost it means to serve her. Don’t say you love your wife unless you prove it with your actions. Words without actions are devoid of love; they are empty and meaningless. And please don’t dare attempt a close encounter of the intimate kind unless love is the driving motivation. Sex without love is both damaging and demeaning.

Paul is not saying you should be continually quoting scripture (logos) to your spouse. He is saying that you are to speak cleansing, encouraging, honoring, affirming, and edifying words (rema) to her. It’s your words, not God’s Word, which Paul is referring to in this verse. Your words have the power to bring out the best or the worst in your wife.

If something you say makes your wife feel devalued, demeaned, denigrated, defamed, or diminished in her own eyes or those of others, you have failed in your obligation to verbally lift her up.

Love is a choice. I choose to love my wife. I choose to love her every day. I’ve been making the same choice for the past forty-six years. My choice to love extends to other people as well. I choose to love people; not because of what they do for me, but because of what God did for me through his Son, Jesus. God has commanded me to love them, and God has commanded me to love my wife. When I choose to love my wife, God honors me with blessings that are uncontainable.

Your family has priority over your work, church activity, personal recreation, and other activities or interests. When you allow a pervasive and imbalanced pattern of scheduled or unscheduled activity to invade your family life, insidious decay starts. Such intrusions automatically erode the foundations of stability and unity in the home. Don’t let extracurricular activities interrupt your home life. Your home life should determine your activities. Show your children your love, sensitivity, and respect for their mother. Hug her often in front of your children. Model how a man should love his wife. Maintain an atmosphere of peace in the home. Shouting, screaming, accusing, and arguing should all be totally banned. The words, “Shut up!” should especially be off-limits. Watch out for atmosphere-destroyers such as loud or confusing music, arguing or fighting among the children, or intrusive television noise, in fact, distracting noise of any kind. Allow children to be part of the adult world. Have them participate in adult conversations and learn to wait their turn. Also, take them with you on trips, errands, and runs to the grocery store. They need to feel they’re part of your life and you are part of theirs. Talk respectfully to your children, and you will earn their respect. Every member of the family should take on responsibilities and tasks in the home—no exceptions. It’s unhealthy for either the mother or the father to do all the work. Everyone should help carry the load. Everyone should work. In some way, involve your family with mission projects or trips, feeding the poor, and world evangelism. Teach them how to give not only their money, but themselves as well.

Be involved in your children’s ministry, school, and sports activities. Take vacations. Children seldom remember what you purchased for them but they will never forget what you did with them. Husbands, encourage your wives to be involved in some of your activities and commit to be involved in some of hers. She may say, “Well, I don’t like football,” and show little interest in watching it with you. Encourage her to join you, even if only for a few minutes, as an opportunity to just sit together. Make sure you show her some attention while she’s sitting with you. For your part, go shopping with your wife once in a while. Most men don’t enjoy shopping, but we need to simply “be” with our wives. Sometimes they like that! Unless you participate in each other’s activities, you’ll drift apart. You must take advantage of every opportunity to bond closer together. Eat together. My wife, Devi, was searching for core reasons explaining the dissolution of the American family. She felt the Lord saying, “Families have left the dinner table.” Yes, we have stopped eating together. The family today is always on the run, eating out, and grabbing meals at fast food restaurants. We eat in the car and in front of the television. We eat at home but at separate times. Eating together develops family cohesion, unity, and health and develops social graces and emotional maturity in our children. Help your wife at every opportunity. Find excuses to serve her.

For example, you might disallow any form of disrespect or “talking-back” or “sassing.” A defiant “no” should never be tolerated. This teaches them to respect parental authority. They must also learn to respect all other forms of authority. In so doing, they will learn the principles of submission. Instruct them about what they can and cannot do and let them know the consequences of breaking the rules. Be sure to follow through on the consequences. This will teach them the necessity and benefit of setting boundaries in their lives. Let your children know that temper tantrums in all forms will not be tolerated. This will teach them self-control. Never allow them to raise their voice to you. Any questions or comments should be spoken at a normal voice level. This will teach them control of attitudes. Convey to them your expectation of the same behavior when they are away from you as when they are with you. This teaches them self-discipline. Finally, teach them to keep their word. This will teach them the foundation of all character. I recognize our current culture frowns upon corporal punishment. Yet, the Bible could not be clearer. God instructs parents

23:13-14, and 29:15. Because he does, it’s important to establish guidelines consistent with the Word of God. First, only use spanking as a form of punishment when the misbehavior is a direct act of rebellion. Spanking should never be a reactionary hit or a “slap on the wrist” but a deliberate and thorough action strong enough to be remembered as a firm consequence for disobedience. Spanking should be applied to the part of the anatomy that has the natural padding—the bottom-side. Secondly, physical discipline should always be controlled and never administered in anger. Spanking is an act of love and love cannot be administered in a fit of rage. Beatings are not scriptural and are counter-productive, often producing rebellion rather than the positive outcome for which a spanking is intended. Finally, after the punishment, the child should be hugged, affirmed, and told they are loved. Do not tell the child what they did wrong, but have them tell you what they did wrong. This way they will learn to admit failures. Also, the child will understand the reason for the spanking and not feel accused. For every act of disobedience there should be a corresponding consequence commensurate in severity with the weight of the infraction. Don’t discipline more severely than the violation demands. The ultimate goal of discipline is to bring your child to the place where he/she will experience the rewards of living

The following suggestions should go without saying, but I’m going to say them anyway. First of all, we model a love for God by making him the first priority in our lives. Be the same person in the home as you are at church. Be consistent. Again, be the first to do whatever you expect from your child. Pray and read your Bible openly before your children, so they can pattern their lives after you. Love their mother lavishly, particularly in their presence. Demonstrate a life of gratefulness so your children won’t grow up with demanding or presumptuous attitudes. Be quick to apologize when you are wrong so they can witness your humility before God and the family. Finally, model a servant’s heart, demonstrating to your family the values of serving and sharing.

Edify and compliment your children in front of others and correct them privately. Don’t threaten them or use fear tactics as a method of training. Take them with you and keep them near you as much as possible. Say, “I love you” and touch them often—hugs, kisses, and love pats are essential to emotional stability. Don’t call them negative names, i.e., “stupid,” “dumb,” “clumsy,” or “fat.” Don’t compare them with other children. Always respect them and honor their individuality. After they complete a project, don’t tell them how you would have done it differently or better.

Teach them punctuality and train them to schedule their time for the most productivity. Make sure they do their homework first before any recreational time. Don’t allow procrastination. Have them pick up their toys (even big kids) and return them to the proper place when they are finished playing with them. This is especially true when they are at someone else’s house. If they played with them, they should pick them up—even if others don’t help. Rough playing should be reserved for the outdoors. Don’t allow running in the house or jumping on the furniture. This kind of behavior breeds disrespect for property and insensitivity to the expression of good manners in various social environments. Teach them social graces. Have them extend their hand when being introduced to others, with a cordial greeting, “Hello, I’m pleased to meet you. I’m ______.” Answer the telephone with, “Hello, this is the Titus residence, Larry speaking.” “Who’s this?” is not acceptable. When calling others, your children should identify themselves first. Teach them to wait until everyone is served before eating. Dads, lead the way in making sure your family eats together.

Don’t allow sports to become the only priority in a child’s life, no matter how gifted the child might be. If balance and responsibility are to be nurtured in the child, sports should come after schoolwork as well as responsibilities to home and family. Also, set a limit on the number of sports or outside activities throughout the year. Don’t give children gifts that they should have to work for and earn themselves. Otherwise they will never learn responsibility. They should at least be able to contribute something to their new bike, new video game, and such. This is especially true the older they get. Expose your children to good influences and positive role models. Separate them from bad influences and negative role models. Don’t allow them to speak publicly in an accusatory fashion to others or to criticize others in private. Obtain a social security number for each child.

Make sure your seed is falling into good soil. Give to that which is worthy. Don’t be emotionally drawn to fruitless or shallow ministries. If you’re going to be a good kingdom investor, sow your resources into productive kingdom investments which demonstrably bring people out of darkness into the light.

que é religiosidade? Trata-se da postura de alguém que estabelece seu relacionamento com Deus por meio de ritos, práticas espirituais e um relacionamento superficial com Ele. É alguém preso ao desempenho, autojustiça e perfeccionismo, gerando um coração orgulhoso. Seu foco encontra-se no mundo exterior, negligenciando as intenções do coração. O religioso é especialista em comparar-se com os outros. É assim que ele avalia sua espiritualidade, sempre olhando para os lados e nunca para Deus

Aquele moço só decidiu retornar para a casa do pai quando se viu obrigado a disputar a comida com os porcos, pois a região em que estava passava por uma intensa fome. Portanto, a falta de dinheiro ― situação pela qual passava já há algum tempo ― não fora razão suficiente para que voltasse arrependido para os braços de seu pai. O que isso significa? Que um dos maiores inimigos da humanidade é o seu orgulho.

Gosto da abordagem do pastor Fábio Damasceno em “A Psicologia do Perdão” [ 25 ] sobre esse assunto. Ao descrever as dimensões do nosso “eu”, o autor nos aconselha sabiamente que somente uma decisão pode nos tirar da prisão da mágoa. Mesmo não sentindo vontade de fazê-lo, é possível decidir perdoar por obediência a Deus.

“Deus, conceda-me a serenidade para aceitar as coisas que não posso mudar, a coragem para mudar as coisas que posso e a sabedoria para saber qual é a diferença. Vivendo um dia de cada vez, apreciando um momento de cada vez, recebendo as dificuldades como um caminho para a paz, aceitando este mundo como ele é, e não como gostaria que fosse; confiando que o Senhor fará tudo dar certo se eu me entregar à Sua vontade. Só assim poderei ser feliz nesta vida e supremamente feliz ao Seu lado na eternidade. Amém!”

É preciso “ir”, assim como aquele rapaz o fez: no sentido espiritual, emocional e, muitas vezes, físico. Nesse processo é preciso mostrar atitudes intencionais e estratégicas.

Naquela ocasião, Deus estava revelando aos homens o que deveríamos ser para Ele, como Jesus era: seus filhos. Ser um discípulo de Jesus significa ter o mesmo relacionamento que Jesus, enquanto homem, tinha com o Pai. Em outras palavras, Deus estava dizendo: “Este é o meu filho amado! Vocês querem me agradar, querem ter um relacionamento íntimo comigo? Sejam como ele! Ajam comigo como Ele age! Sejam meus filhos!”

Os que seguiam essa mensagem legalista consideravam no íntimo que, mesmo após o sacrifício de Cristo, esse ato em si não era totalmente capaz de prover a salvação. Em relação ao princípio da paternidade celestial, essa ideia é altamente danosa, pois fere na essência o amor do Pai sobre nós.

Explicando o contexto que Paulo enfrentava, o comentarista bíblico Norman Champlin apresenta quais os pontos do ensino do apóstolo que eram atacados e quais doutrinas ele precisou explanar para que aqueles cristãos não perdessem o foco em Cristo Jesus. Entre eles, apresenta Cristo Jesus como a base da aceitação espiritual de Deus em relação ao homem (Gálatas 2.16,17; 3.10,17; 4.3-6 e 5.2-4) e a suficiência de Cristo (Gálatas 2.21; 3.18; 4.8,9).

Falaremos sobre a aceitação divina mais adiante, porém quero apenas ressaltar que Jesus não morreu na cruz como um dos possíveis planos de Deus para nos salvar; pelo contrário, essa era a nossa única possibilidade de salvação. Ele nos substituiu na cruz porque somente Ele seria um substituto legal em relação à justiça de Deus. Nesse sentido, nada do que faço merece minha salvação. Depois da queda do homem, nunca existiu justiça suficiente para que ele merecesse salvação. O que Paulo estava advertindo àqueles cristãos está diretamente ligado ao assunto deste livro: somos aceitos por Deus como filhos por meio de Cristo, e ponto final!

LIÇÃO 4: em Jesus você se torna herdeiro. Lemos em Gálatas 3.29: “E, se vocês são de Cristo, são descendência de Abraão e herdeiros segundo a promessa”. Princípio: como o pastor Coty coloca: “herança é questão de filiação e não de merecimento. (...) graça é receber o bem que não merecemos e misericórdia é não receber o mal que merecemos.” [ 34 ] Por ter Jesus em você, é possível levar uma vida em abundância. Todo filho que tem vivido uma vida infrutífera, não tem lançado mão do cuidado e provisão do Pai.

temos a tendência de ver a obra do Espírito Santo somente no que concerne ao seu poder. É fato, pois Ele é o poder de Deus disponível a nós e em nós. Porém, Paulo destaca que uma de suas grandes e poderosas obras é transformar um coração religioso e superficial em um coração de filho. É o Espírito Santo que nos ajuda a termos intimidade com o Pai

Há muitos cristãos que aparentemente são piedosos, mas que no fundo, nunca conseguiram experimentar a verdadeira liberdade cristã. O motivo? Não conseguem viver a apropriação da filiação espiritual. A orientação de Paulo é simples e direta: mande embora qualquer resquício de escravidão.

Para Paulo, o assunto filiação espiritual era totalmente antagônico à forma que os cristãos da Galácia ensinavam e viviam. Paulo chega a ficar extremamente indignado ao ver que aqueles cristãos não estavam desenvolvendo um relacionamento com Deus de Pai para filho: “Meus filhos, novamente estou sofrendo dores de parto por sua causa, até que Cristo seja formado em vocês. Eu gostaria de estar com vocês agora e mudar o meu tom de voz, pois estou perplexo quanto a vocês”. (Gálatas 4.19-20) Para Paulo, a nova aliança elevava o conceito de nossa relação com Deus: um relacionamento próximo, de intimidade muito superior ao que a antiga aliança conseguia proporcionar. Seu ensino é da mesma forma relevante para nós hoje. Precisamos aprender a viver em uma nova dimensão.

The proud cannot receive grace because the proud will not receive grace. This offer of grace is offensive to the proud heart. That is why an uneducated but humble person will receive far more genuine and intimate knowledge of God Himself than a highly educated but arrogant theologian.

I realized that for years I had been functioning with basically one-half of the gospel. I knew how much I needed the forgiveness of sins that Christ provided for me, and I was profoundly grateful. But while the message of God’s forgiveness through the cross relieves our guilt and gives us assurance of where we will go when we die, it does not give us power to live here and now. It is though the resurrection of Christ that any man, woman, boy, or girl on the face of the earth who comes to Him in faith receives His very life through the indwelling Holy Spirit! That’s how we live! Therefore, Ephesians 2:4-5 puts it this way:   But God, being rich in mercy, because of His great love with which He loved us, even when we were dead in our transgressions, made us alive together with Christ (by grace you have been saved) (NASB).

Evangelistic appeals tell people to come forward and receive forgiveness of sins—and then stop there. Too often that is the whole message shared: “Jesus died for your sins. Come receive forgiveness.” Therefore, the gospel that people are hearing is, “You trust in Jesus so you can go to heaven when you die. Now in the meantime, shape yourself up!” And they try, and they fail.

Therefore it is natural to assume that the behavior can never change. So people accept as inevitable and normal a bondage from which God wants to set them free.

The key meaning behind baptism is total identification, and that is exactly what God is trying to teach us. We are born into this world in Adam, spiritually dead, and sinners by nature. Then we hear of the good news of Jesus Christ and trust in Him as our Savior and Lord. At that instant the Holy Spirit of God baptizes us into Christ! “For we were all baptized by one Spirit into one body—and we were all given the one Spirit to drink” (1 Corinthians 12:13). This is something that happens instantaneously to every Christian at the moment of spiritual birth: He is totally identified with Jesus Christ.

What is our inheritance in Christ? And how does knowing this translate into a changed life? In answer, let’s begin with the major principle that ties it all together: You will never have a changed life until you experience the exchanged life. Christians are continually trying to change their lives; but God is calling us to experience the exchanged life. Christianity is not a self-improvement program. It isn’t a reformation project. It is resurrection! It is new life! And it is expressed in terms of a total exchange of identity. Jesus Christ identified Himself with us in our death in order that we might be identified with Him in His resurrection. We give Christ all that we were—spiritually dead, guilty sinners—and Christ gives us all that He is—resurrected life, forgiveness, righteousness, acceptance.

After much time in study and discussion, Lee responded this way: “Bob, if these things are really who I am, then that old activity just doesn’t make any sense, does it?” That’s exactly the point. You see, if a person’s identity is “homosexual,” then homosexual activity is the only natural and logical thing you can expect.

“If you will step out in faith in Christ, Lee, presenting your daily experiences to Him for His evaluation of truth and error—and keep at it—you will find those desires dying down. Now, realize that there will always be the possibility of temptation. As long as you live in this body, you’ll wrestle with the desires of the flesh, so you’ll have to learn to make some wise choices to avoid unnecessary temptation. But over time, the Lord will renew your mind with His truth. That will, in turn, bring your emotions and desires more in line with who you really are—a new creature in Christ. Your daily decision, then, will be to apply Galatians 5:16: ‘But I say, walk by the Spirit, and you will not carry out the desire of the flesh’” (NASB).   I have seen Lee and many others like him go free from a terrible bondage through this message. The only solution is a total exchange. He first had to exchange an identity based on his behavior for an identity based on God’s truth. Lee needed to recognize that at the moment he was born again, he had given Jesus all that he was and had received in return all that Christ is. As 1 Peter 2:24 says, “He Himself bore our sins in His body on the tree, so that we might die to sins and live for righteousness.” Lee needed to learn not only to say “no” to sin, but to say “yes” to the Lord Jesus Christ who indwells him, to not only consider himself “dead to sin, but alive to God in Christ Jesus” (Romans 6:11). Whatever you or I may be struggling with, the answer is the same. It is only through a total exchange that we will begin to see the changes we desire.

Judging by her tone of voice, there was no mistaking her meaning. Marge wasn’t asking out of mere curiosity. She was considering taking her own life. Christians are not immune to such thoughts and desires. In fact, their despair can in some ways be deeper because Christians are supposed to have found the answer to life’s problems. When you have come to know God and still can’t get your life straightened out, then where else can you go? Can God fail? No, the answer to the problem is the same one we have already discussed from several angles: Truth sets you free; therefore, error is what binds you.

Marge said to me, “It was made absolutely clear that you are saved only by faith in Jesus. But never was I taught that, as a Christian, faith is how you live. The emphasis was always on what I should be doing for God, and never on what God has already done and is committed to do for me.”

The reason that people persist in trying to bring law into the Christian life is that they have never come to grips with the real meaning and purpose of the law in the first place. While there were some general purposes of the law of Moses, such as to provide civil laws without which no society can function, its most important purposes relate to leading men to salvation.

Law and grace are opposing principles; they cannot be mixed. When you try to mingle the two, you find that you have ruined both of them: Law is robbed of its terror and condemnation; grace is robbed of its freedom and joy. You end up with a gray no-man’s-land where neither can produce that for which it was created.

In true faith, God is always the initiator, and man is always the responder. In other words, God says something is true or makes a promise, and I respond by acting on it, depending on Him for the results. However, in presumption the order is reversed. Man assumes the role of initiator and tries to use “faith” as a power to force God to be the responder! The “red flags” that will warn you of presumption are when there is a lot of emphasis on faith as a “power” or when there is an emphasis on the amount of faith.

The size of someone’s faith is not important. What is important is the will of God. What the Lord is saying is that if it’s God’s will (as the initiator) that you move the tree, all it takes for you to move it (as the responder) is the faith to speak the command. The real question is always, “What has God said?” Our faith should be the same as that exemplified by Abraham, who was “fully assured that what God had promised, He was able also to perform” (Romans 4:21 NASB).

Where does our power come from? Jesus used a simple illustration to describe our life in Him: “I am the vine, you are the branches; he who abides in Me and I in him, he bears much fruit, for apart from Me you can do nothing” (John 15:5 NASB). Jesus said that He is the vine and we are branches. Think about the role of a branch. Does a branch produce fruit or does a branch bear fruit? It bears fruit! If you cut a branch off the vine and laid it on the ground, how much fruit would come from it? None. There is no power in a branch to produce the fruit; it’s just a “fruit-hanger.” However, a branch can bear tremendous amounts of fruit by just doing what it was created to do: by abiding in the vine and allowing the life of the vine to flow through it.

Notice some other things about branches that are abiding in the vine. They aren’t working hard. They aren’t getting “burned out.” They aren’t considering “giving up the vineyard.” As a matter of fact, they aren’t even concentrating on themselves at all, nor on fruit. It wouldn’t do any good, anyway. The branches are totally dependent on the vine to do the producing.

The writer of Hebrews describes this life as a “Sabbath-rest.” In the beginning, God created everything in six days, “so on the seventh day He rested from all His work” (Genesis 2:2). In Hebrews 4:9-10 the spiritual meaning of this pattern is explained: “There remains, then, a Sabbath-rest for the people of God; for anyone who enters God’s rest also rests from his own work, just as God did from His.” In other words, God wants us to grasp by faith the fact that Jesus Christ has done it all, and there is nothing left for us to perform to be acceptable to God. In other words, “God has done the work; now you rest!”

Realize, though, that “resting” is not the same thing as being inactive. I can’t think of anyone more active than the Lord Jesus Christ, but He was always at rest. At rest in our hearts, we are strongly urged in the Word of God to go forward aggressively and lay hold of all that God has prepared for us. We are called to grow in grace!

The exhortation to grow in grace is a consistent theme in the New Testament. A life of faith is not passive; it requires a firm decision of the will and perseverance to believe God and His Word as your only standard of truth and proceed to apply faith to everyday life. The apostle Paul urged us to “continue to work out your salvation with fear and trembling [a spirit of humility], for it is God who works in you to will and to act according to his good purpose” (Philippians 2:12-13). Notice that it doesn’t say “work for your salvation.” It says “work out your salvation.” As verse 13 makes clear, it is God in us who is initiating His work. Our role is to work out with all our strength what God is working in.

Am I out of work, and tempted to steal?

I get into action, trusting in His promise that “my God will meet all your needs according to His glorious riches in Christ Jesus” (Philippians 4:19).

frequently asked question is, “Will some believers take the message of grace as a license to sin?” I answer it this way: “If their understanding of the gospel goes no farther than the forgiveness of sins—probably yes.

Punishment is a penalty imposed on an offender for a crime or wrongdoing. It has retribution in view (paying someone back what he deserves) rather than correction. Punishment is looking backward to the offense, is impersonal and automatic, and its goal is the administration of justice. The simplest example of punishment in action is the policeman who pulls you over and gives you a ticket for speeding.

Back in high school, I played on the basketball team. We had a coach who worked us hard. He made us run laps. He made us run up and down bleachers. He made us run basketball drills and plays over and over until sometimes I thought my legs would drop off. Why did he make us do all those things? Because he wanted us to succeed! He didn’t do those things because he was angry with us; he did them so that we would be good players and a well-prepared team.

A total contrast! And the crucial application to us is knowing that God, under the New Covenant, never deals with His children on the basis of punishment. All of the punishment of God for our sins was fully received by our Savior Jesus Christ on the cross. Now that we are children of God, He deals with us only on the basis of discipline, which, once you understand the difference, is an extremely positive truth! He is not dealing with us in anger, nor with a demand for justice. He deals with us as a loving Father who is committed to His beloved children and to teaching them to grow in grace.

Não lideramos um negócio e, por isso, dedicação e boas ideias não serão suficientes. Em João 15:5 Jesus nos deixa muito claro que, sem Ele, não podemos fazer absolutamente nada.

No livro Juventude: Ensaios sobre Sociologia e História das Juventudes Modernas, Luis Antonio Groppo[ 03 ] afirma que existe uma concepção segundo a qual o ser humano é pensado como um indivíduo que biológica, mental e socialmente evolui da fase infantil para as fases adultas, sendo a juventude uma fase intermediária. No entanto, o que deveria ser passageiro, tem se tornado cada vez mais longo.

geração atual é uma geração de educação com uma fraca presença dos pais. O número de divórcios no país cresceu mais de 160% na última década[ 06 ]. O resultado é o distanciamento dos pais, físico ou emocional. Temos uma geração que carrega profundas lacunas em suas almas, educados por tios ou avós, que muitas vezes fazem o melhor que podem, ou educados por TVs, videogames e computadores. Muitos não aprenderam a ser um cônjuge, um pai ou uma mãe, um profissional ou a exercer uma vida moral.

Um efeito do momento atual é que a imaturidade comportamental está muito presente no consumismo e tem influenciado os relacionamentos e os comportamentos em geral. Muitos vivem uma adolescência eterna, livres de responsabilidades, fugindo de pressões naturais que a vida traz. O mercado não quer adultos pensando racionalmente em suas compras, mas pessoas gastando por impulso emocional para satisfazer desejos imediatos.

Quem entra no ministério com juventude precisa se posicionar como o apóstolo João. Enquanto muitos se posicionam como se a cultura das trevas fosse imbatível, ele escreveu para todos os jovens da igreja de Jesus ao longo da história: “Filhinhos , eu escrevi a vocês porque conhecem o Pai. Pais, eu escrevi a vocês porque conhecem aquele que é desde o princípio. Jovens, eu escrevi a vocês, porque são fortes, e em vocês a Palavra de Deus permanece, e vocês venceram o Maligno” (1 João 2:14).

O livro do profeta Malaquias ensina aos jovens o poder da filiação e paternidade restauradas: “Vejam, eu enviarei a vocês o profeta Elias antes do grande e temível dia do Senhor. Ele fará com que os corações dos pais se voltem para seus filhos, e os corações dos filhos para seus pais; do contrário, eu virei e castigarei a terra com maldição” (Malaquias 4:5-6). Sabemos hoje que este Elias que haveria de vir seria João Batista (Mateus 11:14) e que prepararia o caminho para Jesus. Esta verdade bíblica nos ensina que a manifestação completa da salvação está ligada à conexão entre gerações e à restauração do relacionamento entre pais e filhos, biológicos e espirituais.

Qual deve ser a abordagem do ministério de juventude frente a uma geração pródiga (esbanjadora), rebelde, sem amor pela família e órfã? “Estando ainda longe, seu pai o viu e, cheio de compaixão, correu para seu filho, e o abraçou e beijou...” (Lucas 15:20b). A emblemática parábola do filho pródigo mostra que a igreja deve ser como a casa do pai: um ambiente de paternidade, perdão e de segundas chances. A graça inclui os que mais precisam, mas também os que menos merecem, e isso reflete o caráter do Pai.

Honra e submissão são inegociáveis em toda a Bíblia. No contexto deste versículo, a expressão “mais velhos” refere-se principalmente aos presbíteros da igreja. Honrar pastores e líderes e viver em unidade é algo a ser trabalhado em profundidade no ministério de juventude. Quando se trata de lidar com o ímpeto juvenil, o assunto é examinado com ênfase, levando-se em consideração o desafio próprio desta fase de vida. A igreja precisa tratar da mesma forma, como valores inegociáveis.

Mostra um caminho para um ministério relevante, que são as boas obras — estas devem estar bem presentes entre os jovens.

Em primeiro lugar, um ministério saudável com jovens reconhece que um programa não pode alcançar eficazmente todos os níveis de compromisso dos jovens. E em segundo lugar, um ministério saudável com jovens leva em consideração o fato de que eles estão em níveis diferentes em suas jornadas espirituais.

É justamente por isso que não basta apenas termos um culto atrativo para os jovens que já fazem parte da igreja. Ela existe também para alcançar os que ainda não estão nela. Assim, o ministério será bem mais eficaz quando definir uma abordagem específica para cada público e estabelecer passos que incentivem pessoas a irem para o próprio nível de compromisso espiritual.

Embora a mulher de Jó tenha sugerido que o marido amaldiçoasse a Deus e morresse (Jó 2.9), ele, por sua vez, agiu diferente. Posteriormente, Jó declarou o seguinte: Ainda que Deus me mate, ele é minha única esperança (Jó 13.15, NVT). Que declaração profunda e profundamente baseada em quem o Senhor é! Mesmo que, além de não fazer nada para socorrer seu servo, Deus ainda decidisse matá-lo — hipótese não tão razoável —, para Jó o Senhor continuaria sendo nada mais, nada menos, que a única esperança! É como se dissesse: “Não importa o que o Senhor faz por mim, mas quem o Senhor é — mesmo que meus pedidos não sejam atendidos, mesmo que eu morra. Deus, tu serás para sempre minha única esperança, meu único Deus, meu único Senhor, meu Único”.

A matéria aqui é intensidade. Sim, existem intensidades distintas de amor, e isso se aplica à devoção do homem a Deus, que pode começar pequena, crescer e terminar gigante. Penso que essa distinção dos níveis de amor também possa ser vista em um jogo de palavras que encontramos no original grego, mas não se percebe na tradução para a maioria das línguas, inclusive o português.

Dois outros termos foram utilizados especificamente no diálogo entre Jesus e Pedro: agapao (αγαπαω) e phileo (φιλεω) — ambos significam amor, mas em intensidades diferentes. Enquanto phileo indica apenas “amor”, agapao, “amor terno”. Aquele apresenta a ideia de “gostar”, e o outro, a de “gostar muito”.

O exercício do ministério é uma manifestação de amor ao Senhor Jesus Cristo. Não é razoável inúmeros crentes nunca se colocarem à disposição para trabalhar pela obra de Deus, enquanto afirmam amá-Lo. Infelizmente, em contraste a uma cultura vivida e admirada no passado, hoje não se absorve bem o conceito de servir — embora o desejo por ser servido esteja em alta.

A igreja jamais cumprirá a grande comissão se não for mobilizada ao trabalho. A antiga ideia de um pequeno clero trabalhando em prol de leigos precisa ser definitivamente banida. Todos são convocados a arregaçar as mangas. Jesus morreu para transformar-nos em ministros, em sacerdotes, é o que a Bíblia diz — e isso não é para alguns, mas para todos: E cantavam um cântico novo, dizendo: “Digno és de pegar o livro e de quebrar os selos, porque foste morto e com o teu sangue compraste para Deus os que procedem de toda tribo, língua, povo e nação e para o nosso Deus OS CONSTITUÍSTE REINO E SACERDOTES; e eles reinarão sobre a terra” [grifos do autor].

o redentor pagava pelo redimido e, portanto, ganhava os direitos de dono. Vou reformular para clarear mais: se eu me tornasse escravo por causa de uma dívida, e um parente me resgatasse, eu não deixaria de ser escravo, apenas mudaria de amo. Eu passaria, então, a ser escravo de meu familiar, já que ele me comprara — literalmente. E qual seria o proveito então? De que adianta ficar livre de um e passar a ser escravo de outro? A diferença estava no redentor. O novo dono pagava a dívida por amor, e não por motivos comerciais, já que um escravo normalmente não valia tanto. O mesmo amor pautava a relação do dono para com seu novo escravo: ele o tratava com brandura, com misericórdia. Assim fica evidente a intenção de Deus ao regulamentar a escravidão. Ele desejava trazer amor para uma relação tão pesada, eliminando a possibilidade de tratamento indigno — seja enquanto o escravo pertencia a um dono qualquer, seja quando ele passava a ser escravo de seu parente. Toda dívida devia ser paga, mas os termos do acordo eram misericordiosos, ainda mais nas situações em que aparecia a figura do parente-redentor. E, é claro, o Senhor não falava apenas àquele tempo — Ele apontava simbolicamente para o Redentor de nossa alma. Ah, que profecia sobre o que estava por vir!

Texto Sagrado revela que Jesus despojou os príncipes malignos. Segundo o Dicionário Aurélio da língua portuguesa, “despojar” significa “privar da posse; espoliar, desapossar”. Isso nos leva a questionar: o que exatamente Jesus tirou desses principados malignos? O que era de posse de tais príncipes e interessava a Cristo? Eles possuíam o domínio, o senhorio sobre nossa vida! O despojo somos nós, que fomos comprados por Ele e, a partir de então, voltamos a pertencer ao Criador. É precisamente dessa forma que as Escrituras se referem a nós.

O versículo diz: por se sentir bem com você — foi daqui que tomei por empréstimo a expressão usada no parágrafo anterior. Na prática — lembrando que o praticado não necessariamente refletia a vontade divina —, qualquer bondade que o servo manifestasse para com seu senhor não era mais do que obrigação; por outro lado, o senhor não tinha obrigação nenhuma de tratar bem seu servo. Quando assim procedia, conquistava o coração do escravo. Semelhantemente, o que nos leva a amar ao Senhor Jesus? É o entendimento de Seu amor por nós!

palavra grega traduzida por “Senhor” é kurios (κυριος), proveniente de kuros, que significa “supremacia”. De acordo com Strong, kurios é: “aquele a quem uma pessoa ou coisa pertence, sobre o qual ele tem o poder de decisão; mestre, senhor, o que possui e dispõe de algo; proprietário; alguém que tem o controle da pessoa, o mestre. No Estado: o soberano, príncipe, chefe, o imperador romano. Um título de honra, que expressa respeito e reverência e com o qual servos tratavam seus senhores”.

O ato de confessar a Cristo como Senhor, portanto, é o reconhecimento da essência da Redenção: admitir que Ele nos comprou das mãos de nosso credor e fez-nos propriedade Sua. Parte de nós a decisão de não receber liberdade, mas permanecer servos, agora sob o domínio de Deus. Isso significa que nos tornamos Seus servos porque Ele pagou nosso preço, mas também porque entendemos o que Ele fez e decidimos viver sob Seu senhorio. Na confissão de Jesus como Senhor, está também implícita a renúncia voluntária da liberdade. Caminhar com Cristo consiste em desistir de ser dono da própria vida e entregar o controle absoluto a Deus. Mesmo quando Ele delega o controle às nossas mãos, nós perguntamos que botão apertar, de que forma, com qual intensidade, quando. Temos liberdade para tudo, mas nada queremos sem a direção, condução e supremacia de nosso Senhor. A liberdade de escolher não pertencer a nós mesmos, mas a Ele, é a única liberdade que nos interessa.

Ao falar de dívida maior e menor, de muitos e poucos pecados, Cristo está, na verdade, apontando como cada um vê a si mesmo. Observe que o Mestre não intencionava desenhar um olhar incriminador de Deus, mas evidenciar a capacidade do homem de enxergar ou não a si mesmo. Ele indicava o olhar humano, e não o divino — isso porque, diante de Deus, poucos ou muitos pecados significam separação; já, para o homem, enxergar poucos pecados no espelho da autoavaliação pode ser perigoso.

Jesus chamou os pecadores de doentes, que precisavam de um médico. Ao mesmo tempo, caracterizou os fariseus como sãos e disse que estes, por sua vez, não precisavam de um médico. A “doença” aqui é o pecado, e o “médico” é Jesus, bem retratado como nosso Salvador. Ao chamar fariseus de sãos, porém, Cristo não alegava que eles não possuíam pecado, pois todos são pecadores — a Escritura é clara acerca disso. Então a que Jesus se referia? À maneira pela qual os fariseus viam a si mesmos, como julgavam-se a seus próprios olhos!

O ponto não é a maneira pela qual Deus nos vê, e sim como nós nos percebemos. Não interessa quanto pecamos e erramos em nossa vida, e sim quanto conseguimos enxergar de nossas próprias faltas e, consequentemente, se somos capazes de vivenciar um verdadeiro arrependimento. Aquele que foi sempre crente pode, com efeito, ser o que menos arrepende-se.

Tomo a liberdade de parafrasear a Bíblia: Por isso, afirmo a você que ela admitiu seus muitos pecados, ela enxergou-se doente e carente do médico Jesus Cristo — por isso muito amou ao Seu Salvador; mas aquele que pouco se admite como pecador, pouco ama ou reconhece Aquele que lhe oferece perdão.

Simples assim! Se, por outro lado, à semelhança de Simão, não enxergarmos nossos pecados — acreditando que pouco fizemos contra Deus —, nos sentenciaremos à incapacidade de expressar gratidão e, consequentemente, impossibilidade de crescer em amor por nosso Redentor.

Com base na afirmação de Jesus, que abordamos desde o início deste estudo, de que quem muito é perdoado também muito ama, eu faço a seguinte pergunta: “Será que Paulo poderia ter demonstrado amor tão grande sem a consciência de ter sido perdoado de uma dívida igualmente grande?”. Não! Na realidade, ele mantinha tal consciência. Ele não se via só pecador, mas o pior de todos os pecadores:

Que caiam escamas de seus olhos como caíram dos meus! Ao abordar uma “grande dívida”, Jesus se referia à capacidade de considerar quão graves são nossos pecados, porque é gravíssimo estar separado de Deus! Essa capacidade de reconhecer a magnitude do pecado não com base no nome do erro, mas em seu efeito de separação, também leva a um arrependimento mais profundo, seja qual for o contexto. Orgulho ou roubo, mentira ou adultério, ofensa ou assassinato, o problema está em ser separado da Vida, ficar distante dEle.

Muitas vezes, não enxergamos nossas misérias porque não permitimos que o Senhor as revele! O caminho contrário, todavia, acarreta revolução no íntimo: quando entendemos, pelo Espírito de Deus — que nos convence do pecado —, a dimensão de nossos erros e pecados e, genuinamente, arrependemo-nos perante o Senhor, então a consciência de tudo o que Ele fez por nós enche nossa alma de gratidão. Começamos a atinar que Ele pagou o impagável!

De modo semelhante, precisamos aprender não apenas a recordar, mas a louvar constantemente o que Cristo consumou por nós, porque isso despertará gratidão. Se aprendermos a viver com tal consciência, tudo será diferente! Nossa autoavaliação será honesta em denunciar misérias, nossa postura não será arrogante, nosso coração rejeitará a religiosidade. Por fim, nosso amor aumentará, com base em uma permanente dívida de gratidão para com Deus.

Nada poderíamos fazer para pagar o que Ele fez! Nossa gratidão não quita a dívida pelo pecado, mas decide louvar e honrar um ato impagável. Esse era o entendimento dos moravianos, que passaram a ter como “grito de guerra” a declaração: “Que por meio da nossa vida o Cordeiro que foi imolado receba a recompensa pelo Seu sacrifício!”

mas o modo com que fizeram isso constrange meu coração. A tradição aponta que muitos morriam cantando. Isto mesmo: louvando até o fim! Quando um abandonava o cântico e passava a gritar — por não aguentar mais a dor e o calor das chamas –, outro continuava a música exatamente do mesmo trecho em que o anterior havia parado.

Assim como a juventude não pode ser uma igrejinha dentro da igreja, cada faixa etária não pode ser um outro ministério de juventude separado do ministério como um todo. Ter uma identidade, uma forma de diferenciar-se é importante, mas não pode ser como um pequeno feudo, com barreiras, conflitos e competição.

Ao trabalhar o crescimento espiritual dos jovens, seja no campo educacional, pessoal ou relacional, procuramos sempre enfatizar que o crescimento é natural para eles. A santidade é natural para eles. Na verdade, escolher não crescer levará a situações que não são naturais para uma pessoa que nasceu em Cristo, gerando frustração e dor.

O que a juventude mais precisa é de hábitos espirituais que fortaleçam o relacionamento real com Jesus, e não de mais programas. Entenda-me bem: os programas, se existirem com um propósito claro, podem ser ferramentas poderosas na vida de um jovem. Mas, ao fim das contas, o que mais fará diferença na formação de seu caráter e de sua caminhada cristã serão os hábitos espirituais que ele desenvolver, por meio dos quais ele aprofundará sua caminhada com o Pai.

Entendemos que este processo seguirá a visão da igreja local sobre este tema. Em nossa realidade, o processo que promovemos para o namoro cristão saudável inclui: 1º - Observar a pessoa em seu ambiente natural; 2º - Desenvolver uma aproximação intencional; 3º - Incluir os pais e líderes espirituais (aconselhamento, oração, prestação de contas, sem controle ou manipulação); 4º - Declarar sentimentos: fase da conquista; 5º - Estabelecer um compromisso de oração juntos (entre 1 a 3 meses, normalmente, com um devocional de oração e jejum, sem beijos, abraços e romance); 6º - Começar o namoro com o objetivo de se chegar ao casamento; 7º - Noivado e casamento (noivado é estabelecido com data de casamento marcada. A fase do namoro transita para a preparação do casamento).

preaching is the most important skill in ordained ministry. The church desperately wants preaching that effectively relates the gospel to human experience. . . . The need for improvement in this skill has been apparent for so long that laity are distressed as to why seminary and church leadership “don’t get it.”

Most preachers by now have learned to enjoy preaching inductive sermons. In the inductive form, one tries to create tension, even suspense, by not letting congregants know what is going to happen next as the sermon unfolds. It is like telling a story that the teller knows while keeping the hearers guessing what is around the next corner. So this kind of sermon (or story) invites, and often even requires, those who share it to become involved in it; what the hearer invariably does is “run ahead” of the teller, and, as everyone who has listened to stories knows, it is fun to do.

The difference is that in the deductive speech mode the audience perceives that almost every word is pre-planned. In the inductive speech mode, the audience senses, or knows, that the words are not planned in advance; neither the speaker nor the audience knows what the next words, or the next sentence, will be.

This is because if a preacher chooses to use the story in the sermon, as is often the case, he or she must actually learn the story in its color and detail in order to bring it to life. If a preacher chooses to retell the Bible story, it must be told well, and from memory. The first step in doing that is writing down the story’s progression and details, including the names, actions, and interactions of its characters.

The preacher, in other words, should find in the material being addressed his or her keenest point of interest and devise a sermon that reflects where the preacher stands vis-á-vis the topic. In that way, the preacher’s interest level is, in fact, piqued at making this point of the sermon, and what results will be a sermon that not only engages the preacher, but because of that engagement, also lends itself to relatively easy memorization.

Of all the things that recent research has taught us about the enhancement of human memory, none is more important than the clear, concise organization of the materials to be memorized. Disjointed materials, of whatever kind, are very difficult to handle in short-term memory. Materials that are unrelated to one another, or that seem unrelated because their levels of abstraction are so high, are difficult to both memorize and recall. The human mind needs order for it to do its work of remembering—not any particular order, or some cosmic order, but its own order. This means that what may seem orderly to one person may appear very disorderly, or disorganized, to someone else.

That is, I go through the sequence titles in order, repetitiously speaking them aloud, continuing down the lis. I do it over and over again until I can almost do it without thinking about them. After twenty or twenty-five minutes of doing that, I isolate the sequences that require memorizing the supporting materials, obviously working mostly on the five Mark sequences. I take them one at a time, this time with my notes in hand, and talk aloud through them. After a half hour or so, the story—built around the order and titles of the sequences—begins to be etched in my mind.

Thatâ€™s why Iâ€™ve written this book. I want to help you see that you have power, through Jesus Christ, to take authority over who sits at your tableâ€”over who influences your thinking. You can take back your freedom and control your thoughts and emotions. You donâ€™t need to be trapped by fear, despair, or rage. Your mind doesnâ€™t have to be stressed. You donâ€™t need to wrestle anymore with harmful thoughts. You are invited to an intimate relationship with the Almighty. The table Heâ€™s prepared for you is one of peace, clarity, and abundance. You donâ€™t have to give the Enemy a seat at your table.

Interestingly, there isnâ€™t one verse in the New Testament that encourages us to seek or to celebrate the â€œpresenceâ€ of God. Why? Because God is now made visible (and for the thirty-three years God was in human skin, tangible) in and through the person of Jesus, who now lives in us through the Spirit. I no longer seek the presence of Jesus. I seek the person of Jesus. Iâ€™m not after the presence of the Holy Spirit. I want the person of the Holy Spirit and His power. Iâ€™m not calling on the presence of God. I have God (Father, Son, and Spirit) living in me.

The oily head part doesnâ€™t make much sense if you donâ€™t know much about sheep. The biggest nemesis for a sheep wasnâ€™t the big, bad wolf (although wolves were a threat, for sure) but tiny parasites and flies. The flies, little harbingers of aggravation, would attempt to lay their eggs in the soft tissue of the sheepâ€™s nose. Yuck. Can you imagine trying to breathe with a breeding factory for flies in your nostrils? The parasites would lodge themselves in the wool around the sheepâ€™s eyes and face, causing skin disease and irritation. So the shepherd would cover the sheepâ€™s head in oil. The oil provided a protective shield that prevented these irritants from finding safe harbor in the wool around the sheepâ€™s face and nose. God, through His Word, wants to protect you from aggravation, lies, and deceit.

Entertaining a harmful thought is as bad as doing a harmful deed. Thatâ€™s key because itâ€™s far too easy to think weâ€™re not sinning merely because weâ€™re not acting on a sinful thought. Hereâ€™s the fact: the thought itself falls short of the glory of God.

Let me lay this pattern out plainly. If youâ€™re feeling lousy and you sin in an attempt to feel better, whatever pain youâ€™re feeling right now will still be there tomorrow morning, only worse.

Rededications are so often packed with the impossible promise that weâ€™ll never sin again. The big problem with rededications is that they can reflect our efforts to clean up our own lives. We make the vow. We do the pledge. We promise to God what we will do to change. And, sorry, but our earnest promises arenâ€™t good enough to cause lasting change. Hereâ€™s a big danger: we rededicate our rededications so often we reach the point of hopelessness. We conclude nothingâ€™s ever going to change. Something must be wrong with the gospel. Or something must be wrong with us.

Surrender comes when we raise our hands and say, â€œGod, obviously I canâ€™t do anything to change this situation. But Jesus, You can. Iâ€™m not going to hide from You anymore. Iâ€™m going to open my heart up to Your love and Your solutions and to the investigative and restorative work of the Holy Spirit. Iâ€™m going to follow You and Your leadership, Jesus. You have finished the work on the cross, and You have ultimately won this war. There might be battles left for me to fight, but Youâ€™ve established a beachhead of victory for me on the shore. Thanks to Your victory, I can go forward. Iâ€™m going to open myself up to the hard work of having You create the change in my life. Iâ€™m going to pray this in the power that God used to raise You from the dead.

When you â€œmake no provision for the flesh,â€ it means you live wisely. You live with discretion. You err on the side of caution. You make environmental modificationsâ€”no matter how radical they might be. Itâ€™s hard to do this alone, so you should be accountable to a few close friends and talk about real struggles and temptations with them.

If you want a way out, God is faithful. The Holy Spirit will give you a way out, and the Holy Spirit will give you another out, and the Holy Spirit, in His mercy, will give you another out after that. The doorways might become smaller and smaller the further along you go. The way out is more difficult to take because youâ€™re further along the pathway, and the potential consequences if you opt not to take the way out become more serious.

What is holiness? The angels are directing us to the perfection of God, the purity of God, the sinlessness of God. But even those words donâ€™t fully convey what holiness is. The word holy comes from the Hebrew word qadash (pronounced kaw-dash). The word conveys two closely related concepts: â€œsacredâ€ and â€œset apart.â€

Godâ€™s glory isnâ€™t fleeting. His glory isnâ€™t measured in a headline. The Hebrew word for glory is kabod, again conveying two concepts: â€œweightâ€ and â€œworth.â

Stephen Covey (of 7 Habits fame) said that we achieve inner peace when our schedule is aligned with our values. That line isn’t from the Bible, but my guess is, if Jesus heard that, he would smile and nod.

That’s why under the Torah all buying and selling was off-limits for the Sabbath. This wasn’t a legalistic rule from the Old Covenant that we’re now “free” from. It was a life-giving practice from the way to break our addiction to the West’s twin gods: accomplishment and accumulation.

A way of living with “ease, gratitude, appreciation, peace and prayer.” A way of working from rest, not for rest, with nothing to prove. A way of bearing fruit from abiding, not ambition.

you’re thinking, Wait, what does optometry have to do with money? this is a first-century idiom that’s lost on our modern ears. In Jesus’ day, if people said you had a “healthy” eye, it had a double meaning. It meant that (1) you were focused and living with a high degree of intentionality in life, and (2) you were generous to the poor.

When you looked at the world, you saw those in need and did your best to help out. An “unhealthy” eye (or as the King James Version has it, an “evil” eye) was the exact opposite. When you looked out on the world, you were distracted by all that glitters and lost your focus on what really matters. In turn, you closed your fist to the poor.

First, people criticized, resisted, overlooked, and left Jesus. Remember, Jesus had a death threat over his life because he healed someone. Crowds of thousands were reduced to twelve because Jesus exposed their misguided reasons for following him (John 6:1–15). Think about that for a while. Doing what will mend others in the gospel will rile and outrage some. Size of crowd has nothing to do with it.

Second, if a crowd reduces because the manner, ways, and values of Jesus are absent in a leader, then change is rightly called for. But if crowds leave because the actual manner and value system of Jesus have confronted and confounded the allure of a world/flesh/Devil mind-set, then it is time to support that leader. He needs our help, not our harm. He has enough of that already.

The difference is subtle, but significant. First of all, you are using a SIM card instead of a main idea. Truth is not a proposition to be argued, but a story to be heard, an image to be seen, and a metaphor to be grasped. Second, stories don’t illustrate the real meat of the sermon (the points); now points simply add some structure to the real meat of the sermon: the SIM card. Begin with the SIM card, weave the SIM card throughout the message, and close with the SIM card.

What kept me writing in the midst of feelings both of humility and futility was this: if God calls you to do something, like preach or write, you must have the courage to do it badly, even when you can’t do it well. But there is no excuse for not doing it as well as you can do it.

Jesus preached only one sermon in his lifetime — the Sermon on the Mount — and it began with the word blessed. Blessed is from the Old English word bledsian or the Proto-Germanic word blodison. Both these words come from the root word blod, from which we get our word blood. Blessing involves blood. No blood, no blessing. To drink blood or to have blood poured over you was to be blessed by whatever it was the blood came from.

Preachers bleed the love of God. Jesus warned his disciples that to journey with him meant carrying the bloody cross every step of the way. This applies most of all to preachers. Ever since that first gospel sermon was preached by Peter (standing “with the Eleven”) after Pentecost,7 to follow Jesus into the preaching life has meant a willingness to sacrifice even life itself for the sake of the gospel.

Preaching is the discipline and craft of turning water into Cana wine22 and decanting the old, aged-to-perfection Jesus wine into new bottles. Preaching is the primary means whereby the miracle of Cana continues, as Jesus turns our life from water — tasteless, colorless, odorless — into homemade vintage wine, known for its vibrant flavor, vivid sparkle, and alluring aroma.

In preaching, each speech act must be a baring and bearing of the story of Jesus in what is less a performance art than a participation art. Preaching today takes place without audiences, only with participants and partners. Giving blood is not a matter of donor and recipient but of donor and participant. Of course, participation art can become performance art. When that happens, preaching moves from being a relational discipline and craft and becomes merely a solitary performance.

If blood is the liquid bearer of incarnational life, preachers are homiletic hemophiliacs, hereditary bleeders of the Word. If you’ve never bled, you have no material for preaching.

Social media has replaced print as the dominant communication choice. The nature of the presumed contract between preacher and people has changed.

Yet to be true to the stories of Jesus, we need to approach them as the life-changing stories they were meant to be. We need to “pollinate” them with the anointing grace of God and the blood of the covenant flowing through us: “I am with you always, to the very end of the age.”18 It is not the preacher’s role to help the Scriptures come alive. The Scriptures are already alive. If they are not alive in our life, it’s not a problem with the Scriptures — it’s a problem with us. Our role as preachers is to help people come alive in new ways to the living Word, “the only force that has the power to change the human heart: The Holy Spirit working by and with the Word in our hearts.”

Semiotics, especially EPIC semiotics, excels in the art of exegeting and animating images. One of the shifts we need to make from traditional preaching to semiotic preaching is to realize that the power of the Word isn’t in the words — it’s in the images, the stories, the music of the text. In traditional pulpit-centric preaching, we learned how to exegete words. Semiotic preaching exegetes images. Preachers must take up the poet’s tools — image and imagination, rhyme and rhythm, simile, metaphor, and story.

For Peirce abduction is the very flashpoint of insight: “Oh, I see!” “I get it now!” “Finally, it makes sense!” “So that’s what you mean!” “I’ve caught on.” “It all fits together now” — although this insight will be, willy-nilly, “extremely fallible

In contrast to those voices calling for the end of the sermon, we need sermons that are more biblical, more inspired by Jesus. That means more artistic and less dogmatic, more real and less accomplished, more provocative and less pietistic, more challenging and less soothing, more life-giving and life-altering and less informative and predictable.

When you read the Scriptures with both eyes open and both brains booked, you read differently. You see signs and patterns and connections. A depth within the story pops out that was hidden by your monocular reading. You read “semiotically” when you read texts as stories animating truth, not a document disseminating facts or points.

A typological reading uses a simple symbol (e.g., character, figure, event) to represent another word, idea, or principle. For example, a dove can be an emblem of peace; an eagle can be representative of the United States; being swallowed by the whale can be a divine banishing to the doghouse. Using the left brain, typologies simply equate one “type” with another to illustrate a point and leave a lesson. They require a predominantly left-brain capacity, even though they often speak symbolically and mask as right brained.

When you read a scriptural story literally, you define the characters and God. But when you read a scriptural story metaphorically or narraphorically — or semiotically — you reveal the characters within their relationships with themselves, others, creation, and God. Metaphorical knowledge does not define God but tracks relationships that point to God and God’s attributes within those relationships. It adds felt truth to factual truth.

To bypass the Holy Spirit reading of the text is to bypass life. To be sure, this is the most intense and most difficult reading. It requires us to harness our critical, doubting, analytical left brain and to “step to the right” and experience God in living color.

Don’t you know, that from every town and every village and every hamlet in England, wherever it may be, there is a road to London? . . . So from every text in Scripture there is a road to the metropolis of the Scriptures, this is, Christ. And, my dear brother, your business is, when you get to a text, to say, “Now what is the road to Christ?” and then preach a sermon, running along the road towards the great metropolis — Christ. . . . I have never yet found a text that had not got a road to Christ in it, and if ever I do find one . . . I will go over hedge and ditch but I would get at my Master, for the sermon cannot do any good unless there is a savor of Christ in it.10

To overcome the deadening effects of habits and to swerve the truth, it is necessary to defamiliarize: to portray familiar things in unfamiliar ways; to approach the subject crabwise, trawling assumptions and surmounting obstacles. Creative preaching is a fertile combination of difference and similarity: so similar that we can recognize it and see ourselves in it, so radically different that we can learn from it and grow beyond ourselves from it.

Let me propose a radical thought: Maybe we have it all wrong! Maybe the Christian life is not about “doing right” to “get blessed.” Maybe the Christian life is not about the blessings of life we so badly want and doggedly pursue. Maybe our obedience and faithfulness are to be energized by a very different motive than receiving the good and legitimate blessings we long to experience in this life.

We’re bidden to come as we are, boldly, without fear, even though our souls still sometimes seem a cesspool of foul muck with no living waters in sight, abandoning ourselves to God for whatever He chooses to allow, waiting for Him to reveal how near we are to Him already in every circumstance of life, and to then draw us nearer.

And they build their entire hope for meeting God on the Cross, more exactly on the One who died there. It sounds extreme, perhaps unrealistic, but followers of the New Way want to know God more than they want anything else. Delightful children who love them; close friends they can trust; honor for what they do; success in family, job, and ministry; an experience of adventure and wonder as they live their lives—all desires, but all second thing passions. No blessing matters more to these people than the Blessing of Encounter.

Followers of the New Way dance with Christ to the rhythm of the Spirit into the presence of God. But they don’t dance especially well. Sometimes they trip over their own feet. Sometimes they lose step with the rhythm and trounce on the Lord’s toes.

As followers of Jesus, they can drink living water that satisfies their thirst and eat rich food that fills their souls with delight. No matter how life is treating them, no matter how discouraged, angry, or empty they may feel, no matter how badly they’ve failed, they can walk boldly into the Holiest Place. They actually encounter God. They meet the Principal, and He hugs them.

But the Spirit is always at work. We believe it and have hope. Eventually we experience it and know joy. Along the way, the New Way, we are liberated from the drive to fill ourselves, to keep feeling good based on good things in our lives, and we are released to live for Christ and to love both God and others. We enter into communion with the Trinity, like first graders enjoying elementary knowledge, but our joy is real; it is partial but real. It comes eventually, guaranteed. There is a linear relationship between living the New Way and enjoying God.

Spirit-given confidence that God is there and worthy of absolute trust breeds the freedom to release what is most alive within you. You begin to feel something stirring in your innermost being. It may take awhile, but at some point you realize, These are the springs of living water! When you stumble badly, you can still hear God sing over you; you have a new purity. When you remember your sexual abuse, you can walk with dignity; you have a new identity. The urge toward sexual sin, though strong, isn’t what you really want; you have a new inclination. The grief that formerly overwhelmed you is no longer in control; you have a new power. You find yourself released to be the person you’ve longed to be—loving, joyful, peaceful, patient, kind, gentle. Never perfectly, but sometimes at least genuinely. And now you praise God and no one else.

No. It’s to reveal Himself as the greatest treasure the human heart could ever imagine, to draw people into a relationship with Him that utterly delights their souls. It’s the Immanuel Agenda.

When Christians marry, we make a covenantal vow to love our spouse faithfully, freely, fruitfully, and forever. From this point on, every significant decision we make is to be informed by that vow. The pace of the church or organization we serve, the commitments we make, and the focus of our heartâ€™s passion are all to be informed by that vow. To put it bluntly, if you are married, it is no longer an option for you to live as if you were single. Why? You made a vow to be married. Yes, it is sometimes painful to connect to your spouse, but in the long term, it is even more painful not to.

So when was the last time you took matters into your own hands and â€œstruck the rockâ€ in your leadership? What â€œpromised landâ€ might you be sacrificing right now? Whatever the particulars of your situation, I can promise that one of the first things to go will be Jesusâ€™ joy and peace. Leadership will become hard. The people you serve will feel like a burden, and you will find yourself wishing you could be somewhere else. You will begin to feel like you are wandering in a desert asking, Where is God? What happened? You might eventually realize where you got off course and attempt to go back and do it all over again. But then you may wonder, â€œWhat will be the cost of that?

Itâ€™s important to distinguish shame from guilt. Guilt is about something I do. For example, â€œI ran a red light.â€ It is one mistake I made, not a reflection of my entire person. Shame, on the other hand, is about who I am. â€œI didnâ€™t just make a mistake when I ran that red light, I am a mistake.â€ When we fall short as a leader, we think things like, Iâ€™m such an idiot. Iâ€™m awful and worthless! Iâ€™m such a fraud â€” this wouldnâ€™t have happened if I were a decent leader. Shame testifies not to wrong doing but to flawed being.6

The work of growing in Christ (what theologians call sanctification) does not mean we don’t go back to the past as we press ahead to what God has for us. It actually demands we go back in order to break free from unhealthy and destructive patterns that prevent us from loving ourselves and others as God designed.

A common, deadly commandment that prevails inside and outside the church is, “You must achieve to be loved.” In other words, we must be competent in the context of competition—in school, sports, recreation, work, neighborhood, church—to feel of worth and value. As a result, many people struggle with an “achievement addiction.” It never seems like enough. We consistently feel inferior. Many of us know the experience of being approved for what we do. Few of us know the experience of being loved for being just who we are.

The problem with most expectations is that they are: • unconscious—we have expectations we’re not even aware of until someone disappoints us; • unrealistic—we may have illusions about others. For example, we think a spouse, a friend, or a pastor will be available at all times to meet our needs; • unspoken—we may have never told our spouse, friend, or employee what we expect, yet we are angry when our expectations are not met; and • un-agreed upon—we may have had our own thoughts about what was expected, but it was never agreed upon by the other person.

Se tal pessoa é uma autoridade espiritual e está causando problema ou em pecado, cabe apenas a Deus destituí-la de sua posição. A única coisa que devemos fazer é orar por ela e não transigir com seu erro (1 Timóteo 2.1-3).

Paulo ilustra a aplicação espiritual com uma questão natural. Aqui se encontra uma prática aparentemente comum nos dias do apóstolo: o reconhecimento de que um filho é, por direito legal, herdeiro de tudo o que seu pai possui. Entretanto, outro elemento importante é destacado separadamente: o tempo em que o filho estaria liberado para usufruir a herança. A herança já era do filho, mas havia um tempo certo para usufrui-la.

Em seu livro O nome de Jesus, Kenneth Hagin cita um episódio vivido por Charles Spurgeon (1834-1892), o famoso pregador batista inglês: Certa ocasião, ele foi chamado à casa de uma idosa, a qual estava confinada à cama. A desnutrição estava acabando com ela. Durante sua visita, Spurgeon notou um documento em uma moldura, pendurado na parede. Perguntou à mulher: “É seu?”. Ela disse que sim e explicou que tinha trabalhado como doméstica no lar de uma família inglesa: “Antes de a condessa morrer, ela me deu isso. Trabalhei para ela durante quase meio século. Tive muito orgulho desse papel, por isso mandei colocar nessa moldura. Está pendurado na parede desde a morte dele, que já faz dez anos”. Spurgeon perguntou: “A senhora me daria licença para levá-lo e mandar examiná-lo mais de perto?”. “Oh! Sim”, respondeu a mulher, que nunca aprendera a ler, “é só cuidar para que eu o tenha de volta”. Spurgeon levou o documento às autoridades, as quais já o tinham procurado. Tratava-se de uma herança. A dama da nobreza inglesa legara uma casa e dinheiro à sua empregada. Aquela mulher morava em um casebre de um só cômodo, feito de caixas de madeira, e estava passando muita fome. No entanto, tinha pendurado na parede um documento que a autorizava a receber todos os cuidados e a morar em uma casa excelente. O dinheiro estava acumulando juros e pertencia a ela. Spurgeon ajudou-a a obtê-lo, mas o dinheiro não fez tão bem a ela quanto poderia ter feito antes. Acho que isso é um exemplo daquilo que tem acontecido à grande parte do mundo evangélico. Moramos em um casebre desmoronado — espiritualmente falando —, enquanto deixamos sobre uma mesa, em algum canto, a Nova Aliança. Temos orgulho dela, mas nunca nos damos ao trabalho de descobrir aquilo que nos pertence, segundo Ela nos assegura.

Logo, não há crescimento imediato. O tempo é indispensável, inclusive no âmbito espiritual. Essa é a razão pela qual Paulo, escrevendo a Timóteo, declara que o candidato ao ministério (episcopado) não pode ser um novo convertido: Não seja neófito, para não suceder que se ensoberbeça e incorra na condenação do diabo (1 Tm 3.6). A palavra traduzida como neófito, no original grego, é neophutos (νεοφυτος) e, de acordo com Strong, significa “recentemente plantado”, o que indica uma planta nova.

E como recebemos a fé? Escrevendo aos romanos, Paulo revela o caminho: A fé vem pela pregação, e a pregação, pela palavra de Cristo (Rm 10.17). Quando a mensagem do Evangelho é proclamada, a própria Palavra possui o poder de acender a “faísca de ignição” da fé.

Existe um jeito de falar, pensar e sentir que é próprio de menino. Ou seja, a imaturidade pode ser vista pela vida sentimental, pela fala e pelos pensamentos. Na verdade, se alguém pensa de forma imatura, consequentemente vai falar e ter sentimentos coerentes com essa infantilidade. Contudo, Paulo nos conta que desistiu dos pensamentos, das palavras e dos sentimentos infantis. Isso nos ensina que é uma decisão deixar a imaturidade. Para crescer, precisamos decidir abandonar as coisas próprias da meninice.

Nem tempestades, nem ventos de doutrina, nem gritos de elogio, nem sussurros de críticas. Nada derruba o maduro — ele aprendeu a manter os pés sobre uma Rocha inabalável. É importante lembrar que ser maduro não é sinônimo de nunca ter-se deixado levar ou abalar. A diferença é que não combina mais maturidade com montanha-russa. Não é mais comum o vaivém na vida devocional, nos aceites emocionais, nos ímpetos doutrinários. Há muito mais equilíbrio.

Tenho visto muitos errarem nesse ponto. A Bíblia diz que, ao casar-se, o filho deve deixar pai e mãe (Gn 2.24). A palavra hebraica azab (בזע), usada nesse texto, significa: “deixar, soltar, abandonar; afastar-se de, deixar para trás”. Acho que isso, por si só, já diz tudo. O cordão umbilical precisa ser cortado! Contudo, mesmo com essa ordenança bíblica, alguns pais não treinam seus filhos a deixá-los. O resultado?

Costumamos dizer que o fogo não queimou absolutamente nada em Sadraque, Mesaque e Abede-Nego, porém isso não é verdade. O fogo teve poder para queimar apenas única coisa: as amarras que os prendiam. Por isso, o rei perguntou: Não lançamos nós três homens atados dentro do fogo? (v. 24). A conclusão do imperador indica com clareza a mudança de estado daqueles homens: Eu, porém, vejo quatro homens soltos (v. 25).

O processo é o que torna a igreja capaz de sustentar a promessa.

Como a igreja, contudo, os grupos não podem se resumir ao cuidado e manutenção pastoral. Um grupo de pastoreio vivo, ativo e multiplicador, que apostolicamente gera líderes enviados para transformar o mundo, não é um lugar de “encher mamadeiras”, mas uma incubadora de destinos, uma agência de mentoria para conquistas.

Sempre assumimos riscos quando mudamos, mas, quando entendemos o porquê da mudança e o que queremos alcançar, esses riscos são minimizados e os ganhos são claros. Cabe lembrar que todos os possíveis ajustes são apenas feitos nos comandos do “balão”; continuamos seguindo os direcionamentos do vento do Espírito.

Think of it this way: if someone has an extremely contagious disease—one that can be transmitted through the air to anyone nearby, what does the community do? They place the sick person in quarantine. This protects the larger community from catching the disease. If not, it will spread like wildfire, and the entire community will suffer from the disease and its consequences. What could be widespread consequences? Vacated positions, loss of productivity, an interruption of services to the community, and economic suffering—to name just a few.

“O que tem lhe prejudicado, excessivamente, nos últimos tempos e, temo que seja o mesmo atualmente, é a carência de leitura. Eu raramente conheci um pregador que lesse tão pouco, e talvez por negligenciar a leitura, você tenha perdido o gosto por ela. Por esta razão, seu talento na pregação não se desenvolve. Você engana a si mesmo, omitindo isso. Você nunca poderá ser um pregador facundo nem mesmo um crente completo. Vamos, comece! Estabeleça um horário para exercícios pessoais. Poderá adquirir o gosto que não tem; o que no início é tedioso, será agradável, posteriormente. Quer goste ou não, leia e ore diariamente. É para sua vida; não há outro caminho; caso contrário, você será sempre, um frívolo, medíocre e superficial pregador. Faça justiça à sua própria alma; dê-lhe tempo e meios para crescer. Não passe mais fome”.

A oração quebranta o homem movido por Deus por meio de sua oração. Assim, o grande exercício da oração é mover a Deus e aos homens. A oração move as mãos de Deus e move o coração dos homens.

If we don’t listen—thus allowing veils to cover our conscience—then the conviction will come through a friend, pastor, or prophet. If we still don’t listen, He will use hardship, adversity, or affliction.

If we avoid sharing the uncomfortable teachings of the New Testament, we can’t say like Paul, “If anyone suffers eternal death, it’s not my fault.” In fact, might the converse be true if we withhold key portions of the New Testament? It was in our power to share the whole truth, but we avoided it. Were we concerned that seekers wouldn’t desire to return to our next service, gathering, or small group meeting?

If we don’t confront practiced sin, the person who receives Jesus will continue to live by the standards set by our society, rather than the Word of God. In our society, it is perfectly normal to live and sleep with your unmarried lover, to practice homosexuality, even to the point of what’s incorrectly labeled as marriage; to drink in excess; to get high on marijuana and other substances; to entertain ourselves with lewd, irreverent, or corrupt programs, videos, or movies; and more—my list is far from complete. Yet all these behaviors directly oppose New Testament commandments.

We should learn from this in the church today. We are heading for difficulty by only giving seekers an invitation to pray a blanket sinner’s prayer, void of calling them to true repentance. What if our “new converts” have no plans to turn away from their sins? We then invite idolaters into our community.

First, what is lawlessness? It is the Greek word anomia. Thayer’s Greek Dictionary defines it as “the condition of [being] without law, because of ignorance of it or because of violating it.” Simply put, one who is lawless doesn’t adhere to the authority of God’s Word. He or she sins on a regular basis without genuine repentance. This person is the modern-day idolater.

In the end, preaching has two basic objects in view: the Word and the human listener. It is not enough to just harvest the wheat; it must be prepared in some edible form or it can’t nourish and delight. Sound preaching arises out of two loves—love of the Word of God and love of people—and from them both a desire to show people God’s glorious grace. And so, while only God can open hearts, the communicator must give great time and thought both to presenting the truth accurately and to bringing it home to the hearts and lives of the hearers

Second, you need to be positioned conservatively enough (with some income set aside for a very rainy day), so that you won’t be forced to sell while stocks are down. It’s the financial equivalent of making sure you’re equipped with safety harnesses, life vests, and sufficient food before heading out to sea.

Bonds are loans. When you lend money to the federal government, it’s called a Treasury bond. When you lend money to a city, state, or county, it’s a municipal bond.

As a young leader, I also made the mistake of treating change as if it were an event instead of a process. It took me awhile to realize that people are always at different levels in their readiness to change. You can’t just announce a change, implement it, and move on. That only causes resistance. You have to give people time and allow them to process changes. While not everyone will get on board or “catch up,” many will if you are willing to help them. Remember: the people are why you do what you do as a leader. How far you can travel isn’t the point; it’s how far you are able to take your people. That’s the purpose of leadership.

Often I hear people say, “Vision unites people.” I disagree. Vision divides people. It separates the people who will from the ones who won’t—and that’s a good thing.

As a leader, you need to pay attention to how your people respond to problems, and you need to help them respond correctly if possible. What does that take? Time, to begin with. You need to observe people up close as they encounter problems to see how they respond. And you need to spend time helping them learn to deal with problems positively. You can’t solve problems for them. If you do, you’ll be forever solving their problems. You must solve problems with them—at least until they get the hang of it.

• Is there a better way to do what we do?         • What can we learn from others who do what we do?         • Who can help us do better in what we do?         • Are the current numbers the best that we can do?         • Am I growing each year doing what I do?         • How can I become better to help my team become better?

I have my own game plan for dealing with failure. It’s the same as the one I have for success: the twenty-four-hour rule. I give myself just twenty-four hours to celebrate a success or cry over a failure. After that I move on. As a leader, I can’t let yesterday control today. Yesterday ended last night. I need to look forward and prepare for today.

The problem with the Be-Good mindset is that it tends to cause problems when we are faced with something unfamiliar or difficult. We start worrying about making mistakes, because mistakes mean that we lack ability, and this creates a lot of anxiety and frustration.

Lion Chaser’s Manifesto                 Quit living as if the purpose of life is to arrive safely at death. Run to the roar.                 Set God-sized goals. Pursue God-given passions.                 Go after a dream that is destined to fail without divine intervention.                 Stop pointing out problems. Become part of the solution.                 Stop repeating the past. Start creating the future.                 Face your fears. Fight for your dreams.                 Grab opportunity by the mane and don’t let go!                 Live like today is the first day and the last day of your life.                 Burn sinful bridges. Blaze new trails.                 Live for the applause of nail-scarred hands.                 Don’t let what’s wrong with you keep you from worshiping what’s right with God.                 Dare to fail. Dare to be different.                 Quit holding out. Quit holding back. Quit running away.                 Chase the lion.

It’s essential to ask questions as a leader. How else will you know where your people are mentally and emotionally? How else will you know what they want and need? How else will you know how to lead them? As a young leader, I used to give direction and then ask questions. (The questions were mostly to verify that people understood my direction.) Today I ask questions first before I even try to give direction.

Growing into your leadership potential will take great time and effort. You will need to be highly intentional. You will have to work for it. You will have to spend your time and money to achieve it. Growth will not come to you. You must pursue it. Effective leadership doesn’t happen on its own. You must go after it. But the journey is as important as the destination. Each step of your journey leads to new discoveries as well as the knowledge that there’s more to learn.

Jesus’s quiet is no manipulative silent treatment. It isn’t an excuse for passive neglect. Nor is his quiet a ruse to avoid words altogether while silently judging us. “Simply to refrain from talking, without a heart listening to God, is not silence” in this wisdom sense.5 Instead, Jesus shows us that he waits in silence for the Father’s voice. Then he speaks.

Touch of the right kind is a sentence. Or sitting on a chair in the room while family members gather is our paragraph. In pastoral care, eye contact, a small nod or shaking of the head, a tear, a smile, a willingness to hold an umbrella over a grieving one’s head in the rain, a willingness to cut bread for sandwiches, a commitment to help the foggy head of weeping make decisions without deciding for them—all this describes an awkward and imperfect stamina for growing present among people without trying to draw attention or make something happen or artificially conjure up a God moment; these more than your words form the tools of your vocation of care.

One of the most important things mommy and daddy time does is to establish the priority of our marriage in the home. Our children get a very clear message: “When the two of us are together, our time is more important to us than even you. ” This may sound harsh to some who have bought into the “children above everything” culture.However, this is a lesson that both you and your children must learn.

It is not enough that we pray as private individuals in our closets; we are required to honor God in our families as well. At least twice each day, in the morning and in the evening the whole household should be gathered together to bow before the Lord parents and children, master and servant to confess their sins, to give thanks for God’s mercies, to seek His help and blessing. Nothing must be allowed to interfere with this duty: all other domestic arrangements are to bend to it. The head of the house is the one to lead the devotions, but if he be absent, or seriously ill, or an unbeliever, then the wife would take his place. Under no circumstances should family worship be omitted. If we would enjoy the blessing of God upon our family, then let its members gather together daily for praise and prayer.“Them that honour Me I will honour” is His promise. 2

Paul echoes this concept when he asserts, “The love of money is a root of all sorts of evil” (1 Timothy 6:10). Of course, it is important to note that he does not call money the root of all evil; it is the love of money that is the culprit. This is a key point. God is not against your having things. He is, however, against things having you. Moses was not calling Israel to forsake prosperity; he was merely warning them not to elevate the gift above the Giver.

No, I didn’t think of myself as a child of God, in daily need of grace, in the middle of my own sanctification, still in a battle with sin, still in need of the body of Christ, and called to pastoral ministry. No, I thought of myself as a pastor. That’s it, bottom line. The office of pastor was more than a calling and a set of God-given gifts that had been recognized by the body of Christ. “Pastor” defined me.

Ministry had become my identity. No, I didn’t think of myself as a child of God, in daily need of grace, in the middle of my own sanctification, still in a battle with sin, still in need of the body of Christ, and called to pastoral ministry. No, I thought of myself as a pastor. That’s it, bottom line. The office of pastor was more than a calling and a set of God-given gifts that had been recognized by the body of Christ. “Pastor” defined me.

But it must be said that maturity is not merely something you do with your mind (although that is an important element of spiritual maturity). No, maturity is about how you live your life. It is possible to be theologically astute and be very immature. It is possible to be biblically literate and be in need of significant spiritual growth.

But for now, we can remember the following: • Stocks have by far been the best place to be for longterm growth over time. • Stocks are volatile. In the pages ahead, you will learn from the “market masters” how to “smooth out the ride” by investing in and diversifying across multiple different indexes. • Don’t be sold that someone is going to beat the market. Instead, align yourself with the market! Once you put your indexing plan in place (which we will do step by step), you won’t have to spend your time trying to pick which stock to buy because the index will have done it for you. This will save you a tremendous amount of time and angst in trying to pick a winner. • Begin to think like an insider! Never again will you tolerate the “herd” mentality in your own life.

As an insider, you are no longer flying blind. You now know that stock-picking mutual funds don’t beat the market over any sustained period (especially after you account for fees and taxes). You also know that fees do matter. And that by lowering your fees, you can get back as much as 60% to 70% of your future potential nest egg. How will this awesome truth impact your future? And finally, you know that average returns don’t paint the real picture. Actual returns matter. And you now have the simple tools to calculate them

Again, though, that nagging question: Won’t the awareness that God loves us no matter what lead to spiritual laziness and moral laxity? Theoretically, this seems a reasonable fear, but in reality the opposite is true. You know that your wife loves you as you are and not as you should be. Is this an invitation to infidelity, indifference, an “anything goes” attitude? On the contrary. Love calls forth love. Doing your own thing in complete freedom means, in fact, responding to her love. The more rooted we are in the love of God the more generously we live our faith and practice it.

Concretely, abandonment consists in seeing the will of God in all the people, events and circumstances present to you. If God tears up your beautiful game plan and leads you into a valley instead of onto a mountaintop, it is because He wants you to discover His plan, which is more beautiful than anything you or I could have dreamed up.

Jeremiah reminds us that a vocation is whatever God wants. It is accepting ourselves just as He made us, with our talents, disposition and character, or the lack of them. God may give us one talent for teaching and five talents for compassion. His demands may be so ordinary, so common, that they stir little response in our emotions. Yet in God’s will alone can we find peace. Even though hidden from us, following God’s will can only mean success.

Do you believe that the material things you ask for are more important or costly to the Father than His only Son? If He has already given you the life of the One who is much more valuable, He will not deny you what is material.

Em primeiro lugar, o espelho é mudo e nos mostra quem somos não pelo som, mas através da imagem. Ele não discursa; ele revela. Não alardeia; reflete. Assim deve ser o pregador. Seu sermão mais eloquente não é o sermão pregado do púlpito, mas aquele vivido no lar, na igreja e na sociedade. Ele não prega apenas aos ouvidos, mas também aos olhos. Não prega apenas com palavras, mas sobretudo com a vida e o exemplo. O exemplo não é apenas uma forma de ensinar, mas a única forma eficaz.

Se o seu nome é Davi e você foi chamado para matar o seu Golias, então não cobice a armadura de Saul, mas pegue a sua própria funda com as pedras, e pela ajuda de Deus o altivo gigante cairá e beijará o pó. O pregador deve ser ele mesmo. Deve apresentar o melhor de si mesmo. Deve consagrar o melhor de si mesmo. Fazendo assim, demonstrará sua sinceridade, honrará o seu Deus e se tornará um instrumento de bênção para o povo sobre quem ministra.31

Antes de levantar-se diante dos homens, o pregador deve viver na presença de Deus. Antes de alimentar o povo de Deus, o pregador deve alimentar seu próprio coração. Antes de pregar ao povo de Deus, o pregador deve aplicar a palavra à sua própria vida. A parte mais importante do sermão é o homem atrás dele.

Todo homem está atrás do sermão. Pregação não é a performance de uma hora. Pelo contrário, é o produto de uma vida. Leva-se vinte anos para fazer um sermão, porque gasta-se vinte anos para fazer um homem. O verdadeiro sermão é algo vivo. O sermão cresce porque o homem cresce. O sermão é vigoroso porque o homem é vigoroso. O sermão é santo porque o homem é santo. O sermão é cheio da unção divina porque o homem é cheio da unção divina.

O propósito do jejum não é obter o favor de Deus ou mudar a sua vontade (Is 58.1-12). Também não é para impressionar os outros com uma espiritualidade farisaica (Mt 6.16-18). Nem é para proclamar a nossa própria espiritualidade diante dos homens. Jejum significa amor a Deus.

Jay Adams comenta: Boa pregação exige trabalho árduo. De tanto ouvir sermões e falar com centenas de pregadores sobre pregação, estou convencido de que a principal responsabilidade pela pobre pregação dos nossos dias é do fracasso dos pregadores em dedicar tempo adequado e mais empenho e energia na preparação dos seus sermões. Muitos pregadores, talvez até mesmo a maioria deles, simplesmente não investem tempo suficiente em seus sermões.

É uma questão de “poder”. Só poderemos com a unção e com a Sua presença: “... se a tua presença não vai comigo, não nos faças subir deste lugar [Moisés]” (Êxodo 33:15).

Paulo, como todos nós, queria alcançar seu potencial máximo, mas batalhava com essa luta interna. Reitero, se o apóstolo que subiu até o terceiro céu e que escreveu a maioria da revelação do Novo Testamento tinha tentações e lutas internas, o que diríamos de nós?

Servir a Deus … 1) Irá tirar o melhor de você. 2) Irá esticar você até quase se romper. 3) Irá testar sua fé algumas vezes. 4) Não é para os fracos de caráter. 5) É para a vida. 6) Não se compara aos sonhos e nem às idéias prévias que você teve antes dessa aventura. 7) É um caminho pedregoso, às vezes reto, às vezes com curvas; outras vezes com obstáculos inesperados, suaves ou difíceis, de altos e baixos. 8) Traz riscos e perigos. Hebreus 11 nos dá uma boa idéia do que é servir a Deus. Sabemos que há missionários em todo o mundo que correm o risco de perder suas próprias vidas pela causa de Cristo. 9) Continua havendo “covas dos leões” de muitas formas e maneiras para aqueles que servem a Deus nas sociedades ocidentais e em outras latitudes que estão se tornando cada dia mais hostis ao Cristianismo.

Church. Godliness and sensuality are mutually exclusive, and those in the grasp of sensuality can never rise to godliness while in its sweaty grip. If we are to “discipline [ourselves] for the purpose of godliness” (1 Timothy 4:7, NASB), we must begin with the discipline of purity. There has to be some holy heat, some holy sweat! Lessons from a Fallen King Where are we to turn for help? The most instructive example in all of God’s Word is the experience of King David as it is told in 2 Samuel 11. Life at the Top As the account begins, David is at the summit of his brilliant career — as high as any man in Biblical history. From childhood he had been a passionate lover of God and possessed of an immense integrity of soul, as attested by Samuel’s words when he anointed him as king: “Man looks at the outward appearance, had done something they considered sexually inappropriate. 3 Christianity Today surveyed a thousand of its subscribers who were not pastors and found the figure to be nearly double, with 23 percent saying they had had extramarital intercourse and 45 percent indicating they had done something they themselves deemed sexually inappropriate. 4One in four Christian men are unfaithful, and nearly one half have behaved unbecomingly! Shocking statistics! Especially when we remember that Christianity Today readers tend to be college-educated church leaders, elders, deacons, Sunday school superintendents, and teachers. If this is so for the Church’s leadership, how much more for the average member of the congregation? Only God knows! This leads us to an inescapable conclusion: The contemporary evangelical Church, broadly considered, is “Corinthian” to the core. It is being stewed in the molten juices of its own sensuality so that it is: ● No wonder the Church has lost its grip on holiness. ● No wonder it is so slow to discipline its members. ● No wonder it is dismissed by the world as irrelevant. ● No wonder so many of its children reject it. ● No wonder it has lost its power in many places — and that Islam and other false religions are making so many converts. Sensuality

A resposta de Jesus é muito significativa nesse contexto: “vá para a sua família; volte para casa. Sua família precisa de você. Ela já vem há muito tempo sofrendo enquanto você estava aprisionado por satanás”. Creio que, hoje, Jesus também diria palavras que valorizassem a família e sua importância na transmissão geracional: “volte para a sua casa com a sua alma, embora você esteja presente no corpo. Volte, você que está aprisionado pelos vícios, pela pornografia e por tudo o que o distancia emocionalmente de sua família”.

Quando a tragédia acontece, os pais vêm, muitas vezes, desesperados, questionando onde erraram ou o que fizeram. Alguns afirmam para se justificar: “Eles iam à igreja com a mãe ou eu os levei à igreja”. Não conseguem perceber que deram todas as coisas materiais que eles pediram, mas não deram a si mesmos; não tocaram a alma dos seus filhos com afetividade e autoridade amorosa; não conviveram no sentido exato de uma convivência que se faz no dia a dia, na transmissão dos valores do Reino de Deus, na segurança que a presença paterna proporciona e que afirma a identidade e valor pessoal, além da direção certa para caminharem na vida fazendo escolhas certas.

O que Deus quer de mim? Assim, a pessoa vai para a Lei e fica o tempo todo na angústia em dar conta do desejo de Deus pela via da Lei e logo a frustração comparece para lançar o indivíduo no sentimento de impotência de dar conta do “desejo” de Deus em sua condição humana. Por não dar conta, cria-se um alto nível de exigência interior e não compreende o que significou o sacrifício de Jesus na cruz, o preço pago. O ser humano quer sempre pagar, “pagar” por algo que nem ele mesmo consegue apreender. A angústia da culpa impõe uma dívida: a dívida, a dúvida e a negação.

Consolados para consolar é uma direção para todos os que experimentaram o consolo de Deus nos momentos dolorosos da sua vida e aceitaram a convocação para serem instrumentos e agentes de Deus para consolar outros: Bendito seja o Deus e Pai de nosso Senhor Jesus Cristo, Pai das misericórdias e Deus de toda consolação, que nos consola em todas as nossas tribulações, para que também sejamos capazes de consolar os que passam por qualquer tribulação, por intermédio da consolação com que nós mesmos somos consolados por Deus (2 Co 1.3,4 — KJA).

One of the most neglected virtues of our daily existence is appreciation. Somehow, we neglect to praise our son or daughter when he or she brings home a good report card, and we fail to encourage our children when they first succeed in baking a cake or building a birdhouse. Nothing pleases children more than this kind of parental interest and approval. The next time you enjoy filet mignon at the club, send word to the chef that it was excellently prepared, and when a tired salesperson shows you unusual courtesy, please mention it.

In an article in Bits and Pieces, [1] some suggestions are made on how to keep a disagreement from becoming an argument: Welcome the disagreement. Remember the slogan, ‘When two partners always agree, one of them is not necessary.’ If there is some point you haven’t thought about, be thankful if it is brought to your attention. Perhaps this disagreement is your opportunity to be corrected before you make a serious mistake. Distrust your first instinctive impression. Our first natural reaction in a disagreeable situation is to be defensive. Be careful. Keep calm and watch out for your first reaction. It may be you at your worst, not your best. Control your temper. Remember, you can measure the size of a person by what makes him or her angry. Listen first. Give your opponents a chance to talk. Let them finish. Do not resist, defend or debate. This only raises barriers. Try to build bridges of understanding. Don’t build higher barriers of misunderstanding. Look for areas of agreement. When you have heard your opponents out, dwell first on the points and areas on which you agree. Be honest. Look for areas where you can admit error and say so. Apologize for your mistakes. It will help disarm your opponents and reduce defensiveness. Promise to think over your opponents’ ideas and study them carefully. And mean it. Your opponents may be right. It is a lot easier at this stage to agree to think about their points than to move rapidly ahead and find yourself in a position where your opponents can say: ‘We tried to tell you, but you wouldn’t listen.’ Thank your opponents sincerely for their interest. Anyone who takes the time to disagree with you is interested in the same things you are. Think of them as people who really want to help you, and you may turn your opponents into friends. Postpone action to give both sides time to think through the problem. Suggest that a new meeting be held later that day or the next day, when all the facts may be brought to bear. In preparation for this meeting, ask yourself some hard questions:

Tell your child, your spouse, or your employee that he or she is stupid or dumb at a certain thing, has no gift for it, and is doing it all wrong, and you have destroyed almost every incentive to try to improve. But use the opposite technique— be liberal with your encouragement, make the thing seem easy to do, let the other person know that you have faith in his ability to do it, that he has an undeveloped flair for it—and he will practise until the dawn comes in the window in order to excel.

The effective leader should keep the following guidelines in mind when it is necessary to change attitudes or behaviour: 1. Be sincere. Do not promise anything that you cannot deliver. Forget about the benefits to yourself and concentrate on the benefits to the other person. 2. Know exactly what it is you want the other person to do. 3. Be empathetic. Ask yourself what is it the other person really wants. 4. Consider the benefits that person will receive from doing what you suggest. 5. Match those benefits to the other person’s wants. 6. When you make your request, put it in a form that will convey to the other person the idea that he personally will benefit.

Não é o desempenho que leva ao veredicto. No cristianismo, no momento em que cremos, Deus afirma: “Este é o meu Filho amado, de quem me agrado” (cf. Mateus 3.17). Vejamos também Romanos 8.1, que diz: “Portanto, agora já não há condenação alguma para os que estão em Cristo Jesus”. No cristianismo, assim que cremos, Deus nos imputa as ações perfeitas de Cristo, seu desempenho, como se fossem nossas e nos adota como filhos. Ou seja, Deus pode nos dizer exatamente o que disse a Cristo: “Tu és o meu filho amado, de quem me agrado” (Marcos 1.11).

Em verdade, os termos discípulo e discipulado foram tão profundamente associados ao ministério de Jesus que, como observa Edward L. Smither, para os primeiros cristãos, o termo “discípulo” tornou-se, basicamente, sinônimo de “cristão”.3 Ser cristão, portanto, é ser discípulo de Cristo.

Com base nesse texto, o ato de seguir Jesus pressupõe três demandas: (1) um certo tipo de amor; (2) um certo tipo de sofrimento; (3) um certo tipo de desapego. No discipulado, essas três demandas não podem ser preteridas. Isso significa que a ausência de uma delas desqualifica o discipulado

Isso significa que seguir Jesus não era apenas embrenhar-se no meio de uma turba que o seguia. A verdadeira igreja não é uma multidão que simplesmente segue Jesus, mas a reunião de todos aqueles que seguem Jesus nos termos de Jesus, ou seja, é a assembleia daqueles que se recusam a seguir Jesus do próprio jeito, meramente como curiosos, retendo apenas o que lhes agrada e descartando tudo mais. Em suma, trata-se da reunião daqueles que seguem Jesus como Jesus quer ser seguido.

No entanto, é preciso dizer que Jesus não estava exigindo que seus discípulos odiassem suas famílias.11 Pelo contrário. Nossas famílias devem ser amadas como o que elas verdadeiramente são: famílias. Quando amamos nossa família mais do que a Deus, nossa família não é amada como deveria ser. Na verdade, quando isso acontece, ela é amada no lugar de Deus. Ela se torna um ídolo que controla toda a nossa vida e agenda. Portanto, o discipulado requer que Cristo seja o centro, e isso terá um custo principalmente se nossa família, nossos bens ou nós mesmos ocuparem a centralidade de nosso coração.

Imitamos um modelo em nossos desejos. Por exemplo, você nunca se perguntou por que as propagandas associam determinados produtos a pessoas admiráveis? As propagandas trabalham com a natureza mimética de nossos desejos. Um jogador de futebol que apresenta um barbeador que ele julga ser fantástico despertará o desejo dos telespectadores por esse barbeador, principalmente se eles admirarem o tal jogador de futebol. Se esse mecanismo não funcionasse, essas propagandas não seriam tão recorrentes.

Por exemplo, nossos filhos não aprendem meramente com nosso discurso, mas, sim, com nosso exemplo. Eles nos imitam desde pequenos. Seja o menino tentando usar as calças largas e enormes do pai, seja a menina tentando equilibrar-se no sapato de salto alto da mãe. Eles nos observam o tempo todo.

Do que adianta essa belíssima estrutura se ela esmaga a própria membresia? Em vez de servir à membresia, ela tem, na verdade, transformado discípulos em voluntários, esmagados por uma máquina de eventos que não para nunca. Para montar um império, você naturalmente precisará de voluntários, mas, para plantar uma igreja, você precisa de discípulos. Nossa missão não é montar um império. O Reino de Deus não é feito de voluntários, mas de discípulos.

So also, when Paul says to the Corinthians (14:27), “if any of you thinks he or she is spiritual,” he means, “if any of you think of yourselves as a Spirit person, a person living the life of the Spirit.” And when he says to the Galatians (6:1) that “those who are spiritual should restore one who has been overtaken in a transgression,” he is not referring to some special or elitist group in the church, but to the rest of the believing community, who both began their life in the Spirit and come to completion by the same Spirit who produces his own fruit in their lives.

My soul thirsts for you; my body longs for you, in a dry and weary land where there is no water.” If those who teach and preach God’s Word, which preaching must be based on solid exegesis of the text, do not themselves yearn for God, live constantly in God’s presence, hunger and thirst after God — then how can they possibly bring off the ultimate goal of exegesis, to help to fashion God’s people into genuine Spirituality?

This includes several things, but at least it means to come to the text with an absolute conviction that it is God’s word; that here God speaks and we listen. Thus our concern in coming to the text is to hear from God. No other stance is exegetically in keeping with the text itself.

Through the gift of his Holy Spirit, the Spirit of the living God, God himself has now become present in the new creation as an abiding, empowering presence — so that what most characterizes the Holy Spirit is koinonia, a word that primarily means “participation in,” or “fellowship with.” This is how the living God not only brings us into an intimate and abiding relationship with himself, as the God of all grace, but also causes us to participate in all the benefits of that grace and salvation, indwelling us in the present by his own presence, guaranteeing our final eschatological glory.

And for him “salvation in Christ” is the activity of the triune God. God the Father, the subject of the saving verbs, has fore-ordained and initiated salvation for his people; God the Son, through his death on the cross, has effected it, and thereby accomplished for his people adoption, justification, redemption, sanctification, reconciliation, and propitiation, to name the primary metaphors. But it is God the Spirit who has effectively appropriated God’s salvation in Christ in the life of the believer and of the believing community. Without the latter, the former simply does not happen.

It should be noted here that “the poor” in both the New and especially the Old Testaments, refers not merely to those in economic poverty. The “poor” are the powerless, the disenfranchised, those whose situation forces them to be dependent on the help of others. Thus it includes especially the widow and the orphan, as well as the alien, and even the Levite. The Old Testament Law, therefore, is filled with statutes that protect such people from the aggrandizement of the powerful, who of course are people with authority — and wealth.

It’s not just about what he has done for us but also about what he has done, is doing, and will do in us if we apprentice under him. It’s about being a person who not only is loved by God but also is pervaded by the love of God. It’s not just accepting the merit of his death but also receiving the power of his resurrection. And it’s not just about you and me as individuals but also about the formation of a whole new humanity and the healing of the cosmos itself.

In both my personal and pastoral experience, the problem is not that people don’t want to change (most do) or aren’t trying to change (most are); it’s that they do not know how to change. We don’t have a good grasp on how the human soul goes from spiritual birth to spiritual maturity. So we have a lot of spiritual adolescents, but few elders.

The genius of Jesus’ ethical teaching was that you cannot keep the law by trying not to break the law. You cannot become more loving by trying to become more loving, no matter how much self-effort you bring to the table. You have to be transformed in your inner person, or what Jesus called “the heart.”

There is a synergistic relationship between our spirits, or willpower, and God’s Spirit, or power. Self-effort and grace are partners, not competitors locked in a tug-of-war for glory. But the main function of self-effort in our formation is to do what we can do—make space to surrender to God via the practices of Jesus—so God can do what we can’t do: heal, liberate, and transform us into people of love.

Jesus is in the business of healing souls. But while the four Gospels have dozens of stories of Jesus instantly healing people’s bodies (after which, by the way, he almost always gave them instructions to go and do something as a next step), he doesn’t seem to do the same with people’s characters. There is not a single instance in which he simply waved his hand to take away an ugly habit or personality trait in one of his apprentices. The opposite is true—we see their stubborn sinfulness live on for years. Jesus didn’t zap them; he just kept teaching, rebuking, and loving them, giving them time to grow and mature.

Salvation is not just about getting back on the right side of God’s mercy through judicial acquittal; it’s about having your soul healed by God’s loving touch. Ironically, the same sin that keeps us from relationship with God can be healed only by God. Yet again, we need to be saved.

Notice, there are two options: “conform” or “be transformed.” To go full Bible nerd on you, both verbs are in the present passive imperative. Translation: It’s a command to keep on doing something that’s already happening. You’re already being conformed or transformed.

Paul is writing to disciples of Jesus in the city of Rome, a formation machine that makes L.A. pale in comparison.

But notice also that the default setting is conformation, not transformation. Meaning, if we don’t take our discipleship to Jesus seriously, the odds are very high that we will become less like Jesus over time and more like “Rome” (or L.A., or London, or Lagos, and so on).

According to Kernberg (1992), narcissists are also pathologically envious. As a result, they exhibit aggression towards those who possess what they covet and believe they are entitled to the most power and control. This is why they don’t want anything to come in between them and their influence over you. Your happiness represents everything they feel they cannot have in their emotionally shallow lives (Kreger, 2012).

Never admits to being wrong. Avoids emotions, empathy and accountability. Rages if anyone challenges their false sense of superiority. Childish when they don’t get their way.

Accountability for abusers is needed because narcissists don’t respond to empathy, compassion or second chances. They respond to potential consequences. Asking for accountability means that we acknowledge that an abusive person is still responsible for his or her behavior and the harm it causes, regardless of the reasons for why the person is abusive.

They can essentially ‘reparent’ themselves in a safe, protective space (Walker, 2013).

The secret to staying ablaze for Jesus is not in responding to altar calls (as good as those are); it’s not in having someone lay hands on you and pray for you (as valid as that is); it’s not in listening to a good teaching tape or the latest worship CD; the only sure source for staying white-hot is in devoting yourself consistently to the place-of-the-shut-door.

If you have given yourself to building people, you have accepted the call to suffer for the sake of the gospel. Leadership in the church is not comfortable and predictable. It’s not a safe place to look for your identity and inner security. Not only is the church filled with unfinished people with sin still resident inside them in the midst of ongoing spiritual war; your leadership community is filled with the same. No one in your leadership community is free of sin. No one is fully spiritually mature in every way. Everyone in your leadership community needs everything the church is intended to provide. So your leadership is internally and externally messy. This is God’s choice. He knows your church or ministry is situated in a world that is terribly broken by sin. He knows that everyone to whom you minister is a person in process. He knows that this will make what you have been called to do difficult. But it has to be said that the hardship, messiness, and unpredictability of ministry is his workroom of grace.

The gospel will humble you because it requires you to confess that the greatest dangers in your life live inside you and not outside you. The gospel calls you to run to God for rescue because your greatest problem is you. The gospel tells you that no matter how long you have known the Lord or no matter how successful you have been in his work, you need his grace right now as much as you did the first moment you believed. The gospel doesn’t work to make you independent and self-reliant, but willingly dependent on God and the community of grace he has placed around you.

It needs to be said that forgiveness is not to be confused with permissiveness, where you turn your head away from wrong and let it slide. When a leader responds that way, he doesn’t do so because he loves the one who wronged him but because he loves himself and doesn’t want to go through the hassle of tense and awkward moments

If you’re a leader, you don’t know everything, you can’t do everything, you aren’t completely mature, and you don’t have inexhaustible energy. You are not just a package of strengths, gifts, and experiences; you are also a collection of weaknesses and susceptibilities. It is here that the gospel is such a sweet encouragement. We do not have to fear our limits because God doesn’t send us out on our own; where he sends us, he goes too. We do not have to curse our weaknesses because our weaknesses are a workroom for his grace. We do not have to hide or deny our places of immaturity because God is able. Our limits and weaknesses are not in the way of what God can do through us, but our denial of limits and our delusions of independent strength are.

In reality, when God gives you ministry and leadership gifts, he is calling you to be willing to suffer. Because of your gifts you will suffer a kind and severity of temptation that others don’t face. Because of the public nature of your gifts, you will suffer dangerous adulation and harsh criticism. The demands of your ministry life will tempt you to neglect your personal devotional life. The attractiveness of public ministry will tempt you to neglect the private ministry of marriage, family, and friendship. You gifts will tempt you to be demanding, irritable, and impatient with people of lesser gifts or who happen to be in the way of what you want. You will be tempted to confuse your giftedness with your level of spiritual maturity. Yes, it is true: your gifts mean you have been called to suffer for the sake of the giver and what he intends to do through you (see 2 Cor. 1:3–11).

Your body is a significant aspect of who you are, but if you look to it as your primary source of identity, then aging, weakness, or disease will rob you of your sense of self. Depression is a deeply personal and powerful emotional experience, but if you take it on as your identity, it will do you even further spiritual and emotional harm.

effective, long-term ministry leadership takes courage. You will face opposition. You will endure accusations, misunderstandings, and questions about your qualifications. At times precious relationships will be strained and family burdens will weigh you down. Physical illness and weakness might at times make ministry look impossible, and you’ll feel weak and unable, not up to the task God has assigned you. The enemy will taunt and tempt. At times your work will bear no visible fruit. You will be tempted to fantasize about an easier place or ministry. There may be times when you feel undervalued and underappreciated. At times you might feel overburdened by trying to balance family ministry with your gospel ministry, and it seems you’re not doing either well.

Vamos refazê-la, usando uma forma mais comum: É possível algo bom ser demais da conta? Sabemos que você já ouviu essa pergunta ser feita antes. E, como para muitos, sabe que a resposta é sim. Há um ponto no qual a sua boa intenção pode se tornar em um grande fardo. É certo que férias são ótimas, porém, um tempo de descanso em excesso o deixará sem dinheiro e desempregado. Embora passar tempo com sua esposa deva ser uma prioridade, muito tempo com ela o fará deixar de ter tempo para Deus, bem como para outros aspectos importantes da sua vida.

Havia duas palavras gregas que o apóstolo Paulo poderia ter usado para significar “tempo” nesse versículo: chronos e kairos. Chronos se refere ao tempo em geral. É o tempo do relógio e origem da palavra cronológico. Kairos se refere a um período de tempo predeterminado, específico. É medido, alocado e fixo.

A escolha dessa palavra, em detrimento da outra, possui um enorme significado. Paulo estava dizendo, em essência, que você possui um período de tempo específico aqui neste mundo. É isso aí. Já está estabelecido. Está acertado. O relógio está andando. Seu tempo está acabando. Mesmo agora. Então, aproveite ao máximo. Não apenas gaste. Invista. Seja sábio com o tempo que Deus lhe tem concedido. Eliminar atividades, conforme Deus o conduz, é escolher ser um sábio mordomo do tempo e dos recursos proporcionados pelo Senhor.

A Palavra de Deus nunca nos chama de coitadinhos, mas nos ergue ao posto de mais do que vencedores. Não somos vítimas, Ele não nos vê assim. A Palavra de Deus também não ordena que você reclame o tempo todo os seus direitos – não que isso seja errado em determinadas circunstâncias –, mas afirma que você deve aceitar perder, mesmo tendo direito. Jesus tinha direito, mas “a si mesmo se esvaziou, assumindo a forma de servo” (Fp 2.6). A Palavra de Deus também não diz que sou o que eu sinto, mas que sou aquilo que Deus diz que sou, porque Ele é a fonte da minha identidade, não meus sentimentos.
